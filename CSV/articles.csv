 I happened to feel in the opposite ways a weight in Italy and a resource abroad The path of Andrea Lombardo 33 years original architect of the Valle d aosta brought him around the world between Spain Germany and Japan three years ago the decision To return to Italy and try to work in his country but after months of battles I have now moved to Switzerland in Zurich Andrea graduated from the Polytechnic of Turin specializing in architecture for sustainability the first abroad experience in the direction of Germany in Hamburg in 2013 Then the dream was realized in the drawer to work in Japan in one of the most renowned architecture study in the world was an incredible experience from various points of view you worked from crazy from 10 in the morning until midnight sometimes smiles in 2015 Andrea moves to Barcelona to specialize in new construction techniques and nanotechnology for architecture At the end of 2017, of the future he decided to return to Italy my former university colleagues had just founded an architecture study and they had proposed a collaboration but the experience lasted less than expected too many differences from the economic conditions to the work mentality I started shortly after To accept a job in Switzerland, she lives today and works in Zurich where she covers a position in a large multinational and is a professor in an university of architecture for Andrea when you are on the other part of the world, you are only you all against everyone, I also shop in Tokyo In a metropolitan area of ??over 30 million inhabitants, the differences between Italy and the other countries in which the Aosta Valley architect has experienced are numerous cost of life taxation salaries if in Spain the average salary is around 1 500 euros with the taxation similar to that of Italy in Japan the rent is very high more than 800 and Uro per month for 25 square meters and a subway race to move to the city center can cost to cost 7 8 euros the salaries then are not so high to guarantee a dignified life, also to Oxford I deal with quantum physics here was The job to seek me to return to Italy is my dream in the drawer the big difference is that my job in Italy is made by the famous false VAT games with massacrers and lower salaries adds Andrea Fare the architect to Spain and Japan is valued Ti Feel important also in Switzerland there is no one who tramples the profession of the other as often happens with the role of surveyors in Italy these professions have come to have merciless figures the personal relationship with Italy for Andrea is very strong even if the universities contrasted they are excellent and p They also repatrite in the professional field today with three degrees and four languages ??known, the 33 -year -old architect is embittered because after trying 2 times to return it is again abroad there are potential in Italy that are clearer from here I think only of all our assets UNESCO that are not exploited what I feel is regret and frustration is done so much and then efforts are not recognized for young people to try to live away from their loved ones from culture from nutrition from their own language also to understand and appreciate the place more In which you live even if she admits to leaving your country is a huge sacrifice C is another aspect to consider in Italy the family is a very important element with a closer relationship abroad the family is much colder you can see parents one or twice the year also read My career from Singapore to Norway returning with the pension the brains are not on the run but on the road and it is right to return to Italy was weighted and with the awareness he explains that I had difficult months in front in 2021 I made the crazy decision To leave a country like Switzerland with a very profitable career from all points of view a quality of life excellent I made a leap in the ravine to return to 33 years of age wants to say to go back to play friendships and knowledge to be in your hometown is not Just as he hoped after a few months I am again in Switzerland if Italy does not change I don't think I return anymore but I hope so concludes Italy abroad is very renowned Italian researchers abroad in the design and architecture sector are very good you have to be more Aware of what it means to be Italian
 In Silicon Valley, making errors is a necessary condition to be able to innovate most of the startups fail but they are always seen as learning opportunities this mentality together with the capital and infrastructures in my opinion have generated well -being and progress Andrea Carafa lives in California and it is Occupied of technological innovation for the environment, health and social well -being as an entrepreneur investor and university professor both in the United States and in Europe ready to return to Italy one day with the right conditions yes it would be nice to be able to contribute to the relaunch of our country thanks to the skills And to the networks that I developed abroad Andrea was born and raised in a small town in Southern Italy after his university studies in Rome had the opportunity to make the last year of a three -year degree in Finland thanks to the Erasmus program after having worked and continued the Studies abroad between Denmark Spain and Franci Andrea became Marie Curie Fellow I did research on emerging technologies with high impact potential at the European Commission in Brussels and Grenoble I also carried out research periods at the Bocconi in Milan and CERN in Geneva and then landed in Silicon Valley recalls To the fact it also read to Oxford I deal with quantum physics here was the job that was looking for me to return to Italy is my dream in the drawer in California Andrea is now a professor and Founding Emergence Fellow in Stanford as well as being director of the Blackstone Launchpad an accelerator Startups and teacher at the University of California Santa Cruz also collaborates with the UN and other public and private organizations on issues related to the use of technology for the objectives of sustainable development Andrea has always had luck says he is welcomed to Brac Cia open and with availability of help some of the main differences between Italy and Silicon Valley are saying in favor of the economic development of the latter qui c is a very pragmatic approach and therefore less bureaucracy then there are abundant capital and a whole series of Infrastructures to invest in innovative technologies Creating startups and making them grow in the United States there are more and more funds that invest in startups that deal with climate change energy and ecological public health and other strategic interests for the country often I find myself thinking how the Italy can return to create more work and well -being thanks to research innovation and the creation of innovative startups as it is done in the United States and in many other developed countries explains for too long, however, we have not fortunately done it in recent years the government e Other both public and private actors have started To allocate more and more funds to innovation, just think of the National Fund for innovation as it continues to the PNRR funds for innovation and the ecological energy and digital transition in short, for Andrea things are changing are being born of startup accelerators and technology transfer poles in All of Italy the Italian startups are collecting more and more capital following trajectories similar to those of other European countries who have started before they have already brought home excellent results such as France Germany and Spain read even before I was a warehouse worker are now hired in Oxford the problem Of the brains fleeing from Italy there is no reverse flow by observing all this remotely from Silicon Valley with the awareness of those who have lived in first person how much innovation can bring progress and resilience progress and resilience He adds that Italy has an important opportunity in front of it to global challenges we will have to respond with so much innovation and international collaboration as happened after the recent volcanic disaster in Tonga and after the invasion of Ukraine for example with startups around the world that They immediately made products and services available such as artificial intelligence algorithms for satellite images free solutions for the transfer of funds and solutions to ensure internet access to areas affected by attacks and natural disasters what the family is lacking more than Italy Traditions that lead us to share a lot with a lot of conviviality are very tied to Italy and Europe I go back at least twice every year and I still feel a beautiful connection with my land in Italy, however, the absence of work and favorable economic conditions have pushed many and too many young people and less young a Leaving the country in the past fifteen years our families today are too often divided by borders and oceans with their children abroad and parents in Italy I think that precisely from the innovation from research and young people the country can and must start the new Leonardo da Vinci Rita Levi Montalcini Adriano Olivetti and Margherita Hack we make them blossom and grow once again in Italy we finance their research and startup projects concludes and we no longer let them run away abroad
 I went away in October 2004 Vienna Mom and Dad accompanied me to the night train was the beginning of my adult life we ??all understood that something was finishing and something was starting Andrea Mordini is 46 years old and is originally from Pievepelago a small town 2 thousand inhabitants on the Apennines Modenese lives abroad for almost 20 years, moving to 10 different countries after studying in civil engineering in Modena and Parma Andrea has carried out a doctorate of research that allowed him to start his international career with a period at the University of Vienna as a student I dreamed of going around the world to deal with bridges and so it was reminded of it it took part in important projects in at least about fifteen nations obtaining an MBA Master in Business Administration NDR between a project and another one one Watch along thousands of kilometers from Italy to Singapore passing through Austria Holland Libya India Qatar Australia United Arab Emirates Thailand today Andrea lives and works in the city Asian State I would not want to give the message that is enough to go abroad to find roses and flowers nothing gives anything to anyone from anywhere in the world smiles to change nation every couple of years means finding difficulties In the language in culture in work I learned to be a very flexible and tolerant person probably only so can we survive all these changes of residence in Qatar and in the United Arab Emirates I found a strong separation between the Expat community and the local community the possibility To make friends varies a lot depending on the context is very easy in the Expat community because after all we are all away from home and we all look for friends and it is equally difficult to get to know the local community often closed and almost waterproof to foreigners especially in Qatar the working day of Andrea all abroad, however, is not nient And more normal responds lunch office with colleagues gym after work or for dinner to discover some new dish that I then try to replicate I am learning the local cuisine that in Singapore is a mix influenced by the Chinese and Indian Chinese cultures there are differences in taxation Between Singapore and in general the rest of the countries in which he lived and Italy Singapore has a tax -linked taxation but which is still much lower than Italy, the level of services is highly high, however, it is necessary to pay attention because healthcare is not free and It is therefore necessary to activate your private insurance is a system that I don't like adds because it could lead to discrimination for the less well -off when you are far from Italy we appreciate our health system in every way if the taxes in Singapore seem low can nothing can Equiliate the Middle East no taxation on income for salaries Instead Andrea explains that it depends a lot on the position you have are about double in Singapore three times in the Middle East the Middle East Qatar and United Arab Emirates is a completely different world than all the other countries in which it has lived as expat you live in A bubble with a high salary and with access to a luxurious lifestyle that is not possible to find anywhere else if it were to give advice to an Italian student today given my personal experience I would recommend a period abroad as soon as possible if I could go back I would go abroad even before already during the University with the Erasmus program The choice to leave however it is still very personal it is not for everyone and it depends on so many factors adds in any case if there is the idea of ??going I always suggest to try There is always time to return if things are not going well because then many boys and girls go away no N I know the working conditions in Italy I started moved by a great curiosity to see the world I thought if everything goes wrong I take my suitcase and I go home then I never went back to Italy and Andrea replies so perhaps by stable to the sea but not Before about twenty years he warns when you ask him what the nation is in these 10 years that hit him more Andrea replies the next one is not a joke concludes is the spirit of being ready to move again if necessary and embracing the new experience with Enthusiasm and passion maybe I will stop in Singapore for the rest of life maybe not it does not matter if you embrace a lifestyle like mine you have to be ready to change again
 I went away from Italy in August 2016 I accepted a three month opportunity in New York I wanted to get out of European comfort was a challenge I wanted to grow 35 years old Roberto Ceravolo is originally from Calabria. And better smiled for two years has returned to Pizzo di Calabria where he worked in Smart Working for his three -year graduation company in Management Engineering in 2011 Master's Degree always in Engineering in 2015 Roberto immediately started working in a large Italian car company then the decision To accept a job offer arrived from the United States I had to stay three months I remained three years remembered the day of departure c was excitement the usual problems with visas the fear and the desire to try a job outside Europe was in front of me one State with all its complexities from health to security was a professional challenge And and human Roberto lived between Baltimora New York and Charleston the USA are a place where I felt at home in my opinion diversity is considered a wealth and New York is almost as if it were the capital of the world he says to the fact it awake in the morning Soon Metro from Brooklyn to Manhattan in the office until 6 pm many colleagues were expat and usually went to get a beer before returning home on weekends you lived the city among cultural events concerts Museums Theaters there are so many things to do or To see that three years have not been enough for ten years I have left Italy and my life is in Zurich the greatest difficulty is not to start but to create new roots the differences between the two countries compared to the world of work are substantial in New York There are many more opportunities is true but only if you are American citizens or you are in possess I know of the green card with the permanent visa explains Roberto in the USA according to my experience we work less and better especially in teams in America if you work late you are considered inefficient smiles the Italians according to Roberto are welcomed and treated with a lot of respect by the American companies thanks To the great cultural background that they are missing, the atmosphere is what only the United States know how to give is like living constantly within a film An example is Baltimore there you breathed true America in New York Roberto has found a community of international students and researchers While Charleston reminded him of Southern Italy for Roberto, however Italy remains the most beautiful country in the world, my relationship with the country of origin is wonderful despite all its defects I love my town in 2018 after the death of a expensive relative to whom it was Very tied Roberto has decided to return since then my values ??are cam Biati I prefer to stay at a maximum of 2 hours of flight from my lace I would have lived another 5 or 6 years in the USA without this aspect even if in the long run I think that Italy from a work point of view is better since 2019 so Roberto has accepted an offer from a Italian company where today he holds the role of strategic commercial manager I deal with marketing and commercial plans explains Roberto has also returned by exploiting the measure of the government that facilitates the return of the brains on the run and guarantees a better economic treatment also read my life in Mexico from Ten years I love Italy but we remember us researchers only when we get important results today works between Milan and Calabria lace in Smart Working at 80 obtaining a promotion among other things because the results are there even if you work remotely adds many of its colleagues instead They are resigning to return to the headquarters for Roberto the office is instead only a place where you go to team Building when you necessarily have to deal with others if you work for objectives and you have the right tools you can work wherever you explain future continuing The Pizzo Smart Working or moving to another Italian city Rome or Naples or maybe in the long term open its own company to return to the United States is a certain option but only for a limited period of time not for all life my future is wonderfully I have never had certainties in my life concludes and sometimes that's okay
 I went away from Italia the first time in January 2013, UK towards me on that day, horizons opened that I had not even dared to imagine Isabella Sorace is 32 years old and comes from a small village in the province of Bergamo left Italy after two Non -paid internships since then it has not been back all that it started thanks to a scholarship in Milan for my specialist degree I got a bag that covered all the costs in Bocconi so I completed the Master of Science in Finance in English that moment He completely changed my prospects coming from a very modest background I would never have imagined to go to Bocconi during the specialist the young Bergamo experienced in Israel and England and carried out two unpaid internships in Milan and one in London for a big one Banca Italiana The first contract work by Isabella instead dates back to 2013 in Milan I was a technical consultant for a group The decision to leave for Switzerland in the first months Isabella works in a small startup in the first months to cover the expenses in June 2016 enters a large multinational company based in Zurich in the role of Senior Consultant over the years I have grown in this Company tells to be senior manager today the next step is the construction of my team and the promotion to Director smiles in Switzerland you can breathe international air much more than in Italy companies tend to get the best from the various cultures explains Isabella even if anyway We are talking about a backward country regarding the situation of women despite this in my company I grew up as I could have done in Italy I am recognized a level of respect by everyone that as a young woman I would not have experienced at home in Milan on the contrary Isabella has worked for two companies with a global presence but the ambi Work Authority reflected some extremely hierarchical Italian stereotypes reluctant to patriarchal innovation in Zurich, lunch hours start at 11 45 not at 13 30 tells Isabella the supermarkets are closed on Sunday and in general the shops make office hours this because many Swiss women unfortunately not They work we move above all by public transport if there is a good weather on a bike and only if you really need the car eating outside is spontaneity particularly expensive does not exist and to go out with most people you have to organize with at least 3 weeks of Advance which I find very difficult smiles Swiss wages throat to many but you have to understand that a two -room apartment in the center here costs 2 500 francs per month the health insurance you pay separately to send a child to school can cost 3 000 francs per month and the tax burden is not low as you would expect Sorace also wrote a book that collects the stories of a lost generation The life from Expat is often much more complex than how you imagine it from Italy call us brains on the run as if all we carry behind it was only our work is not Thus leaving is the easiest thing to remain then stopped in a new country for a long time becomes complicated in Zurich there are many Italians but most of them do not remain after a few years return to Italy or move elsewhere the difficulty lies in putting new Radici thinks of returning one day C is certainly the desire to live in a country where I speak well the language where I share the culture of food and most people live in spontaneous and unscheduled world, however, there are important aspects of Switzerland that today Isabella In Italy the economic condition would not find the work environment his grandparents have moved from the south to Florence his dad in ger Mania his mom in Lombardy today his parents live in Paris his sister in Amsterdam we have always been an international family for us emigrating has never been considered abnormal abroad I have become more patriot than I was in Italy he concludes how no country is Perfect makes you appreciate your more if I had to find a job that gives me the same satisfaction as I have in Zurich I could actually think of returning if not I wait for the pension
 I have not been satisfied for years at the end of the day, the stress accumulated in Italy for my work especially during the pandemic had almost killed me literally I was reborn now I don't do the bureaucrat I only do the thing I always liked to be a doctor the doctor Dr. Francesco Porro is sixty years old a wife and two children is of Calabrian origin and today he works as a pediatrician in a clinic in Zurich where he moved in September 2021 after thirty years in the Italian health system found himself in a hospital bed hit by A stroke that miraculously did not leave me permanent damage I was still in convalescence when I made contact with a pediatric clinic here in Switzerland an interview on zoom and they sent me the contract his is a story of a brain on the run that as a young man has made of everything to return from Germany to the time I returned for a matter of feeling selling the life of my emigrant parents c He would always want to be able to return to their land is the late eighties Francesco is 25 years old when he graduated in Modena voting 110 and praise I remember that I went to the doctors order to look for my first occupation but at the time of work there was not a Less than recommended, it is back in the Stuttgart area by the parents and finds work in a pediatric clinic associated with the University of Tinbinga in Esslingen a simple interview a few days of trial and I was hired but the desire to return to Italy was too strong a feature was too strong Of the emigrants I saw in Germany tell it was often to live near the station this sense of physical closeness was transformed into a mental closeness of being able to say here when I want to take the train and return to Italy, read also I live in London since 2013 and I organize removals not always leaving It is the ri He moves but wanting to do it and not trying is the worst regret for his return, Dr. Porro tries the road of the American military bases I went to work in the emergency room of the military hospital of Bad Cannstatt what I struck me was the talks made by these US soldiers who asked me little about what I actually knew how to do what would have seen in the trial period while the questions were on what I thought of the doctor's task as I saw my job and so on after three years he manages to be transferred to Pisa in the base clinic of Camp Derby then in a clinic in Florence as a general practitioner while at night he was a medical guard until 2018 until he climbs the ranking he can access the convention as a general practitioner I had finally had the agreement for General Medicine I thought I had reached tranquility a stable job and a regular life leek, however, clashes in the first Person with the National Health System today Com is set with 1500 patients no longer alive with the AFT territorial functional aggregation are the groups of doctors who seven days a week from eight in the morning to 20 00 must guarantee the protection of the health of the patients entrusted by the system Healthcare editor's doctors have become bureaucrats while the ASLs leverage to make you do the things that want to save the days spent managing budgets in addition to taking care of patients, showed how much each doctor spent who spent less received a bonus And not a little even 8 thousand euros in the year so you were incentivized to save the pediatrician, for example, the objective of reducing prescribed antibiotics took place, you took an average of prescriptions if you were taking the bonus then there are guidelines from So to follow is also a system that serves underlines I see it here too in Switzer However, here are private insurances a patient thinks and evaluates the urgency together with the doctor otherwise if you sfor your expense roof next year the insurance increases we are more free to make our decisions and we are not penalized that his departure is not It was a matter of money, the doctor clearly states if I do two accounts, since the cost of Zurich high life is although the taxation is at 12 in Switzerland there are a series of indirect expenses for which at the end of the month I remain 4 thousand francs in Italy with A little private activity I had even earned more after paying taxes read also I live in Finland since 2002 and now I am the first Italian principal in a school in the home of my home is now here that's why the arrival of the pandemic has done nothing but worsen The situation the patients called you at any time I spent most of my time on the phone was as if we doctors were an obstacle to go beyond their will, often insisted with urgencies above all the band from fifty years up because they had the exemption and did not have to pay even if not c It was no urgency and they only clogged the system is now all questioning anything about the therapies vaccines is asked less to a mechanic who repairs you the car that not to the doctor who gives you a medicine and when they were not patients who pressed came The bureaucracy vaccinated 300 patients last year and every patient complicated your life because it was necessary to do a whole series of bureaucratic passages that required hours otherwise the system did not give you other vaccines a working problem for the Italian one that is felt by many doctors the colleagues who I feel they are all at the limit in this situation who does not go out for a better working quality Try to retire and generational change is not because they have blocked specializations for years, Italy has long been a problem of lack of doctors not only those of the family as reported by all trade associations and trade unions if something will not change in ours The country the health system will not be able to withstand Francesco's does not want to be a farewell still has good intentions for his land Florence remains our house where our friendships are despite all my idea is to return in a few years and work in Italy Until the pension, however, with a different awareness that this experience has given me and that I am happy to have done
 I chose to do business in Italy because I felt the need to fully know my origins Matthew Modabber is 22 years old and was born and raised in New York as Italian American parents has decided to leave for Italy just turned 19 today directs one Chain of shops with her sister in the heart of Lombardy my family made huge sacrifices to stay in New York remembers Matthew at the fact that they are and I will always be grateful they were the ones who pushed me to apply for Italy they taught me to Having the mind open the roads to achieve a goal are infinite smiles Matthew decides to leave for Milan to study International Economics and Management at Bocconi University and it is precisely at that time that as a university student notices a deficiency within the choice of fast meals To be consumed on a lunch break reduced to pizzette sandwiches and dishes ready from here the choice to found together To his sister Venus a chain named Salad House l Italy today is very different from what we knew explains the 22 year old offers many more entrepreneurial ideas than the closed economy of once among the Italian cities Milan is the one that most has an international breath that It offers more opportunities for foreigners people are curious to discover new places and new tastes and there is the Fomo Fear of Missing Out adds Matthew attended a degree course where the 70 of the students was international and that like me he was recreating a family of friends in Italy obtaining, among other things, the recognition that the Milanese university assigns for academic excellence to those who have characterized the structure of the universities is radically different from the United States and these differences start from high school in the United States are favoring group works much more importance is given to the world of work through meetings with companies s tage and field experiences encourages the development of creative and less notionist ideas in the United States continues the young entrepreneur the taxation is less and the procedures are different in Italy there is much more bureaucracy the legislation of the labor market and the contractual forms make a lot Complicated operating, the pandemic has engraved considerably but not enough to have Matthew's projects and objectives abandoned we had to postpone the opening of 3 stores with a significant economic and moral loss despite this tried to invest to improve internal processes And the delivery the staff of the chain is almost entirely under 26 explains Matthew together with his sister Venus has also started following other projects and dealing with new companies today manages 3 between Italy and America and is manager for a startup that has already obtained 30 million dollars of loans currently living between Mila No and New York trying to take the best from these two cities tells for me the routine is very important so even when I travel or change the country I try to stick as much as possible to my pace I wake up around 6 in the morning medit for 10 minutes I drink one Shake I reply to the most urgent messages or emails and I prepare to get out of work better in the cafes that at home smiles until recently I was always in my clubs to take the lunch shift now I have a less operational role also read in London since 2013 And I organize removals leave is not always the answer but wanting to do it and not trying is the worst regret because then many Italians leave their country I think it is a vicious circle in a country where hires are so onerous for companies C is little space for Attracting and retaining talents would serve more competitiveness between Profess ionists by encouraging companies to entrepreneurial risk and therefore the possibility of taking more flexibility if it were to give advice to young Italians would be to try to meet as many people as possible of different backgrounds you never know when an opportunity from the United States will present you missing there Optimism and the cult of the client of Italy Matthew loves the warmth of people Mediterranean life the possibility of traveling to Europe so easily the variety of activities in such a little space in 10 years the young Italian entrepreneur Italus dreams of his company developed in a European context But in spite of everything I conclude I see myself contributing in the Italian entrepreneurial context
When in 2013 he started from his little village in Sardinia Jerzu Samuele Mura he was 23 years old I remember well that day I cried I was leaving my land my family my friends today almost 10 years later lives and works in London is the head of a team of 10 people all Sardinian but a nice coincidence is no parochialism smiles everything was born from a remote job I worked by Sardinia for an English transport company tells Samuele Fewi they dealt with international removals even if they were in great demand so I used the money saved To open a site, record the name and thanks to some old customers who followed me I started with the first move, the logo tells the whole of the region's flag but instead of the dying four houses Samuele left its land with the promise to return at least 3 times the year friends and the family did not believe I would really go away some thought sar He returned immediately smiles to carry on a startup and making entrepreneurship in the UK is not simple at the beginning of England is tough it does not give you anything and it is a bit like if he tried to test you often adds Samuele you make the mistake of thinking that only to be Party you have to receive something in return instead it is precisely the opposite there is a lot of competition and you have to earn every single step fortunately being very meritocratic if you give us inside you start very soon to see the fruits the day revolves around its two main activities that of Entrepreneur and the most recent one of a sports agent The base is in Oval a more or less central area from there Samuele moved to the office in Highbury or goes around for some meetings the teams that I have created over time allow me to carry on both without them it would not be possible to read too After abroad still in Italy to open my company I seem to have never gone from it, that's why I chose to return to the United Kingdom according to Samuele's experience an employee costs the company only about 13 of his net salary an abyss compared to that who costs an employee to an Italian company, taxation for companies is then lower but above all more slender I still remember with a smile every time in the first months of the company's life we ??received checks with reimbursements from the government office responsible for the Collection of taxes we had paid more VAT or more taxes than everything without having requested anything certain of England is not the country of toys adds there are defects and disadvantages but taxation and bureaucracy are certainly not among these at the same time the Italian training it is certainly of a high level responds but especially compared to the UK it is still done To too much theory and little practice for Samuel many Italians decide to leave the country in order not to be judged limited by speeches linked to the age of the social class to meritocracy c is then the desire not to want to settle for wanting to make themselves in their own field adds the Sardinian entrepreneur thinks Often to what his life would have been if he had not chosen to leave sometimes he is almost afraid to think about it I would not have been able to do all the experiences to combine contacts to grow my company I would not be working in the world of football in close contact with the Champions that as a child I was watching on TV I would certainly have got away but most likely I would have had the huge regret of not having tried it also read work in one of the best US research centers from Italy they tell me you will see that you no longer come back but I still hope you are wrong an adventure that of the name of the company editor's note started with a simple intuition and which today organizes removals for destinations such as Australia United States and China after 10 years of houses emptied filled boxes and memories transported around the world Samuele's dream is to open a Office in the United States, perhaps in New York or Los Angeles, the future of these days seems difficult to imagine us even only the next year smiles the staff for young Italians is to consider all the choices well I would like to tell them that the answer is not always starting Starting is not always the right thing that is the worst thing that one can have is the regret of not having tried often we do not do something for the simple fact that you are afraid of failure to fail in some cases is the most beautiful thing you can Do
The departure is the first for the United States at sixteen guests of a family between the forests of Oregon C is the return a year later with a look forever changed on life and on the possibilities that abroad can offer but also to remove there are The nostalgia of the house is loneliness, friendships the suitcases to be closed to open up always to be redone the ceremony to celebrate San Nicola Sinterklaas typical of the Netherlands where instead of embarking the table for imminent Christmas you eat a soup the student holidays in which the guests are They sit in a circle in Amsterdam works like this and the awareness of having become foreign time in a new land all this we read in Michela Grasso's book The future cannot wait because my generation is forced to start by deagostini portrait and voice Of a phenomenon so well known as to have now almost legendary traits the brains fleeing from Italy not only professional You but also very young guys who choose to go abroad to study and work some others do not seek that future that inside the national borders has blurred or far away Michela Grasso is one of them after the year in Oregon has returned to Italy it was Graduated and later he left for the Holland where he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam choosing political sciences, social networks know her as the mind of the SpaghectoPolitics account over 230 thousand followers and the photo of Silvio Berlusconi with Bandana as an image of the profile A NATO project reads in the Book to tell Italy abroad is seen as this mystical country where you eat well is warm but that it would work better if it was not the Italians to govern Voices collected in the text that are joined to the personal experience of the author someone has started In search of a lifest lifestyle far from discrimination like Luca others choose the Via dell'Anno sabbatico at 43 years for example Andrea Tianzi instead decided to return to his origins and from Italy he returned to Shanghai in China and Michela reports his own Journey starting from the beginning arrives in his accommodation in July 2018 with two huge suitcases and a ramp of stairs in front of seventeen roommates with two bathrooms and a kitchen the first months pass in the movement of independence that I had never known the beauty remains but takes place Behind the difficult the loneliness of integration despite the common European matrix recalls the dinners who have passed in silence because it dense with references to specific topics of local culture then known step by step and dinner after dinner the black contracts in a restaurant for tourists paid 5 35 euro per hour to work all day between the suspicions and looks of those who consider GL The Italians the usual lazy eternal the disorientation Michela is neither immigrated nor expat when I was exploited in a restaurant in the center of Amsterdam my employers as my colleagues considered me an immigrant when instead I was in a university classroom to discuss of international politics with the professors I was seen as an expat and precisely the university gives his experience the breath that was looking for above all in comparison with the other Dutch and international students and with the professors the lessons are a dialogue that unites the two parts listening Never miss the nostalgia of the house is shared with the other guys and mitigated with the recipes that the grandmother sends them from Italy by writing at the end of the messages hello beautiful the book is dedicated to her now Michela Grasso has started again for France where she will remain For a few months the question that sooner or later reaches all the brains on the run strikes it in full t He will adorn in Italy he tries to respond among the conclusive stripes if I think of the sea of ??my Liguria to the hazel trees that dot the Irpinia of my memories and to the chaos pulsating in Milan that is never silent to me and I feel Italian up to the core but They do not believe those who tell her that if they love her country, she must necessarily be left, it is not only a whim behind those closed suitcases and empty rooms there are months perhaps years of dreams of ideas and rethinking only by closing the door of my room from For the last time I managed to understand what was out and how much the young people really count for Italy and I hope that these skills that I slowly acquire at abroad I can take them home one day View this post on Instagram a post shared by spaghettipolitics spaghettipolitics
 Returning to Italy one day perhaps when I retire Stefano Fasciani is 39 years old and is an electronic engineer of Roman origins in 2007 he left his work full -time and indefinitely in the capital to go abroad Singapore direction no one forced me to go Via I just wanted to experience and grow from a professional and human point of view three -year and specialist degree to Tor Vergata in Electronic Engineering Stefano for 4 years has worked as an engineer in a company in Rome over 15 years between Singapore at the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University and Emirates Arabi today covers the role of Associate Professor at the Department of Musicology of the University of Oslo where he deals with Music Technology in Norway tells Stefano gives himself much more importance to private life and family compared to work some differences make them the reads but the vast difference make your colleagues Their cultural background and their aptitude tells the fact that even after abroad still in Italy to open my company I seem to have never gone to it that's why I chose to return to the level of legislation and taxation Norway and Italy for Stefano are Very similar to Singapore, however, you pay less taxes but the state gives you nothing especially if you are a foreign healthcare is guaranteed by a private insurance that pays you the employer the pension does not exist if you want to send the children to school you have to pay in the Emirates United Arabs you earn your path well is recognized and enhanced especially if you come from university level the taxation on income is zero but you have no continuous public service the professor you pay also to go for a complaint from the police send your son to school Costa more than pag there are also taxes in these countries you have nothing guaranteed there is no welfare if you lose the work there is no subsidy you go for Stefano the Italian training is of excellent level the courses and the exams are more difficult to basically the 18th in Italy is a Vote that students try to avoid yet represents the 60 of the minimum threshold to pass the exam here in Norway in theory we pass with 41 elsewhere with the 50 this tells you so much on the level of Italy adds when Stefano studied engineering in Italy at the level of workshops Infrastructures to do research, on the other hand, were not many resources recalls due to pandemic in Norway between March and April 2020 have closed the university in a precaution despite very few infections, teaching has been distorted the emergency situation has generated an additional amount of work by removing time in search explains how coordinator of a Master Cross Camp program Us in Music Communication and Technology adds Stefano already made a lot of online with our students and colleagues divided between Oslo and Trondheim was simple for us to migrate to 100 on the platforms on the net, read Italian research is hungry does not have funds in Chile is continuously Movement here is how I work at the Southern European Observatory Stefano does not absolutely share the rhetoric of the brain escape in the research area explains the brains must circulate it is right that those who study have the opportunity and the opportunity to go circular from Rome to Zurich to Sidney in the academic field Diversity experiences abroad open your mind what is missing are foreign researchers who come because it is known that in Italy the language is often spent in research represents a problem even if many universities are today Nizlendo to have specialist degrees in English to attract foreign students as well as the system of competitions The problem of the Italian University is the method of hiring in all other countries where I have worked there are no competitions you choose the figure that serves the department most if I have A doctorate position I write a specific work announcement the profile and select with an external commission the candidate the competition leads you to assume the best at the absolute level but not what you need at that moment a advice to young people abroad will face problems whose culture and way of thinking is different from your becoming open and tolerant with the others responds the Roman professor to get out of the bubble and dare to risk without fear by being out of you realize how many positive things there are in Italy who is often and willingly ends up To criticize everything smiles Stefano if I had not left concludes the To my life it would have been much more boring and without satisfaction
 I happened to feel in the opposite ways a weight in Italy and a resource abroad The path of Andrea Lombardo 33 years original architect of the Valle d aosta brought him around the world between Spain Germany and Japan three years ago the decision To return to Italy and try to work in his country but after months of battles I have now moved to Switzerland in Zurich Andrea graduated from the Polytechnic of Turin specializing in architecture for sustainability the first abroad experience in the direction of Germany in Hamburg in 2013 Then the dream was realized in the drawer to work in Japan in one of the most renowned architecture study in the world was an incredible experience from various points of view you worked from crazy from 10 in the morning until midnight sometimes smiles in 2015 Andrea moves to Barcelona to specialize in new construction techniques and nanotechnology for architecture At the end of 2017, of the future he decided to return to Italy my former university colleagues had just founded an architecture study and they had proposed a collaboration but the experience lasted less than expected too many differences from the economic conditions to the work mentality I started shortly after To accept a job in Switzerland, she lives today and works in Zurich where she covers a position in a large multinational and is a professor in an university of architecture for Andrea when you are on the other part of the world, you are only you all against everyone, I also shop in Tokyo In a metropolitan area of ??over 30 million inhabitants, the differences between Italy and the other countries in which the Aosta Valley architect has experienced are numerous cost of life taxation salaries if in Spain the average salary is around 1 500 euros with the taxation similar to that of Italy in Japan the rent is very high more than 800 and Uro per month for 25 square meters and a subway race to move to the city center can cost to cost 7 8 euros the salaries then are not so high to guarantee a dignified life, also to Oxford I deal with quantum physics here was The job to seek me to return to Italy is my dream in the drawer the big difference is that my job in Italy is made by the famous false VAT games with massacrers and lower salaries adds Andrea Fare the architect to Spain and Japan is valued Ti Feel important also in Switzerland there is no one who tramples the profession of the other as often happens with the role of surveyors in Italy these professions have come to have merciless figures the personal relationship with Italy for Andrea is very strong even if the universities contrasted they are excellent and p They also repatrite in the professional field today with three degrees and four languages ??known, the 33 -year -old architect is embittered because after trying 2 times to return it is again abroad there are potential in Italy that are clearer from here I think only of all our assets UNESCO that are not exploited what I feel is regret and frustration is done so much and then efforts are not recognized for young people to try to live away from their loved ones from culture from nutrition from their own language also to understand and appreciate the place more In which you live even if she admits to leaving your country is a huge sacrifice C is another aspect to consider in Italy the family is a very important element with a closer relationship abroad the family is much colder you can see parents one or twice the year also read My career from Singapore to Norway returning with the pension the brains are not on the run but on the road and it is right to return to Italy was weighted and with the awareness he explains that I had difficult months in front in 2021 I made the crazy decision To leave a country like Switzerland with a very profitable career from all points of view a quality of life excellent I made a leap in the ravine to return to 33 years of age wants to say to go back to play friendships and knowledge to be in your hometown is not Just as he hoped after a few months I am again in Switzerland if Italy does not change I don't think I return anymore but I hope so concludes Italy abroad is very renowned Italian researchers abroad in the design and architecture sector are very good you have to be more Aware of what it means to be Italian
 In Silicon Valley, making errors is a necessary condition to be able to innovate most of the startups fail but they are always seen as learning opportunities this mentality together with the capital and infrastructures in my opinion have generated well -being and progress Andrea Carafa lives in California and it is Occupied of technological innovation for the environment, health and social well -being as an entrepreneur investor and university professor both in the United States and in Europe ready to return to Italy one day with the right conditions yes it would be nice to be able to contribute to the relaunch of our country thanks to the skills And to the networks that I developed abroad Andrea was born and raised in a small town in Southern Italy after his university studies in Rome had the opportunity to make the last year of a three -year degree in Finland thanks to the Erasmus program after having worked and continued the Studies abroad between Denmark Spain and Franci Andrea became Marie Curie Fellow I did research on emerging technologies with high impact potential at the European Commission in Brussels and Grenoble I also carried out research periods at the Bocconi in Milan and CERN in Geneva and then landed in Silicon Valley recalls To the fact it also read to Oxford I deal with quantum physics here was the job that was looking for me to return to Italy is my dream in the drawer in California Andrea is now a professor and Founding Emergence Fellow in Stanford as well as being director of the Blackstone Launchpad an accelerator Startups and teacher at the University of California Santa Cruz also collaborates with the UN and other public and private organizations on issues related to the use of technology for the objectives of sustainable development Andrea has always had luck says he is welcomed to Brac Cia open and with availability of help some of the main differences between Italy and Silicon Valley are saying in favor of the economic development of the latter qui c is a very pragmatic approach and therefore less bureaucracy then there are abundant capital and a whole series of Infrastructures to invest in innovative technologies Creating startups and making them grow in the United States there are more and more funds that invest in startups that deal with climate change energy and ecological public health and other strategic interests for the country often I find myself thinking how the Italy can return to create more work and well -being thanks to research innovation and the creation of innovative startups as it is done in the United States and in many other developed countries explains for too long, however, we have not fortunately done it in recent years the government e Other both public and private actors have started To allocate more and more funds to innovation, just think of the National Fund for innovation as it continues to the PNRR funds for innovation and the ecological energy and digital transition in short, for Andrea things are changing are being born of startup accelerators and technology transfer poles in All of Italy the Italian startups are collecting more and more capital following trajectories similar to those of other European countries who have started before they have already brought home excellent results such as France Germany and Spain read even before I was a warehouse worker are now hired in Oxford the problem Of the brains fleeing from Italy there is no reverse flow by observing all this remotely from Silicon Valley with the awareness of those who have lived in first person how much innovation can bring progress and resilience progress and resilience He adds that Italy has an important opportunity in front of it to global challenges we will have to respond with so much innovation and international collaboration as happened after the recent volcanic disaster in Tonga and after the invasion of Ukraine for example with startups around the world that They immediately made products and services available such as artificial intelligence algorithms for satellite images free solutions for the transfer of funds and solutions to ensure internet access to areas affected by attacks and natural disasters what the family is lacking more than Italy Traditions that lead us to share a lot with a lot of conviviality are very tied to Italy and Europe I go back at least twice every year and I still feel a beautiful connection with my land in Italy, however, the absence of work and favorable economic conditions have pushed many and too many young people and less young a Leaving the country in the past fifteen years our families today are too often divided by borders and oceans with their children abroad and parents in Italy I think that precisely from the innovation from research and young people the country can and must start the new Leonardo da Vinci Rita Levi Montalcini Adriano Olivetti and Margherita Hack we make them blossom and grow once again in Italy we finance their research and startup projects concludes and we no longer let them run away abroad
 I went away in October 2004 Vienna Mom and Dad accompanied me to the night train was the beginning of my adult life we ??all understood that something was finishing and something was starting Andrea Mordini is 46 years old and is originally from Pievepelago a small town 2 thousand inhabitants on the Apennines Modenese lives abroad for almost 20 years, moving to 10 different countries after studying in civil engineering in Modena and Parma Andrea has carried out a doctorate of research that allowed him to start his international career with a period at the University of Vienna as a student I dreamed of going around the world to deal with bridges and so it was reminded of it it took part in important projects in at least about fifteen nations obtaining an MBA Master in Business Administration NDR between a project and another one one Watch along thousands of kilometers from Italy to Singapore passing through Austria Holland Libya India Qatar Australia United Arab Emirates Thailand today Andrea lives and works in the city Asian State I would not want to give the message that is enough to go abroad to find roses and flowers nothing gives anything to anyone from anywhere in the world smiles to change nation every couple of years means finding difficulties In the language in culture in work I learned to be a very flexible and tolerant person probably only so can we survive all these changes of residence in Qatar and in the United Arab Emirates I found a strong separation between the Expat community and the local community the possibility To make friends varies a lot depending on the context is very easy in the Expat community because after all we are all away from home and we all look for friends and it is equally difficult to get to know the local community often closed and almost waterproof to foreigners especially in Qatar the working day of Andrea all abroad, however, is not nient And more normal responds lunch office with colleagues gym after work or for dinner to discover some new dish that I then try to replicate I am learning the local cuisine that in Singapore is a mix influenced by the Chinese and Indian Chinese cultures there are differences in taxation Between Singapore and in general the rest of the countries in which he lived and Italy Singapore has a tax -linked taxation but which is still much lower than Italy, the level of services is highly high, however, it is necessary to pay attention because healthcare is not free and It is therefore necessary to activate your private insurance is a system that I don't like adds because it could lead to discrimination for the less well -off when you are far from Italy we appreciate our health system in every way if the taxes in Singapore seem low can nothing can Equiliate the Middle East no taxation on income for salaries Instead Andrea explains that it depends a lot on the position you have are about double in Singapore three times in the Middle East the Middle East Qatar and United Arab Emirates is a completely different world than all the other countries in which it has lived as expat you live in A bubble with a high salary and with access to a luxurious lifestyle that is not possible to find anywhere else if it were to give advice to an Italian student today given my personal experience I would recommend a period abroad as soon as possible if I could go back I would go abroad even before already during the University with the Erasmus program The choice to leave however it is still very personal it is not for everyone and it depends on so many factors adds in any case if there is the idea of ??going I always suggest to try There is always time to return if things are not going well because then many boys and girls go away no N I know the working conditions in Italy I started moved by a great curiosity to see the world I thought if everything goes wrong I take my suitcase and I go home then I never went back to Italy and Andrea replies so perhaps by stable to the sea but not Before about twenty years he warns when you ask him what the nation is in these 10 years that hit him more Andrea replies the next one is not a joke concludes is the spirit of being ready to move again if necessary and embracing the new experience with Enthusiasm and passion maybe I will stop in Singapore for the rest of life maybe not it does not matter if you embrace a lifestyle like mine you have to be ready to change again
 I went away from Italy in August 2016 I accepted a three month opportunity in New York I wanted to get out of European comfort was a challenge I wanted to grow 35 years old Roberto Ceravolo is originally from Calabria. And better smiled for two years has returned to Pizzo di Calabria where he worked in Smart Working for his three -year graduation company in Management Engineering in 2011 Master's Degree always in Engineering in 2015 Roberto immediately started working in a large Italian car company then the decision To accept a job offer arrived from the United States I had to stay three months I remained three years remembered the day of departure c was excitement the usual problems with visas the fear and the desire to try a job outside Europe was in front of me one State with all its complexities from health to security was a professional challenge And and human Roberto lived between Baltimora New York and Charleston the USA are a place where I felt at home in my opinion diversity is considered a wealth and New York is almost as if it were the capital of the world he says to the fact it awake in the morning Soon Metro from Brooklyn to Manhattan in the office until 6 pm many colleagues were expat and usually went to get a beer before returning home on weekends you lived the city among cultural events concerts Museums Theaters there are so many things to do or To see that three years have not been enough for ten years I have left Italy and my life is in Zurich the greatest difficulty is not to start but to create new roots the differences between the two countries compared to the world of work are substantial in New York There are many more opportunities is true but only if you are American citizens or you are in possess I know of the green card with the permanent visa explains Roberto in the USA according to my experience we work less and better especially in teams in America if you work late you are considered inefficient smiles the Italians according to Roberto are welcomed and treated with a lot of respect by the American companies thanks To the great cultural background that they are missing, the atmosphere is what only the United States know how to give is like living constantly within a film An example is Baltimore there you breathed true America in New York Roberto has found a community of international students and researchers While Charleston reminded him of Southern Italy for Roberto, however Italy remains the most beautiful country in the world, my relationship with the country of origin is wonderful despite all its defects I love my town in 2018 after the death of a expensive relative to whom it was Very tied Roberto has decided to return since then my values ??are cam Biati I prefer to stay at a maximum of 2 hours of flight from my lace I would have lived another 5 or 6 years in the USA without this aspect even if in the long run I think that Italy from a work point of view is better since 2019 so Roberto has accepted an offer from a Italian company where today he holds the role of strategic commercial manager I deal with marketing and commercial plans explains Roberto has also returned by exploiting the measure of the government that facilitates the return of the brains on the run and guarantees a better economic treatment also read my life in Mexico from Ten years I love Italy but we remember us researchers only when we get important results today works between Milan and Calabria lace in Smart Working at 80 obtaining a promotion among other things because the results are there even if you work remotely adds many of its colleagues instead They are resigning to return to the headquarters for Roberto the office is instead only a place where you go to team Building when you necessarily have to deal with others if you work for objectives and you have the right tools you can work wherever you explain future continuing The Pizzo Smart Working or moving to another Italian city Rome or Naples or maybe in the long term open its own company to return to the United States is a certain option but only for a limited period of time not for all life my future is wonderfully I have never had certainties in my life concludes and sometimes that's okay
 I went away from Italia the first time in January 2013, UK towards me on that day, horizons opened that I had not even dared to imagine Isabella Sorace is 32 years old and comes from a small village in the province of Bergamo left Italy after two Non -paid internships since then it has not been back all that it started thanks to a scholarship in Milan for my specialist degree I got a bag that covered all the costs in Bocconi so I completed the Master of Science in Finance in English that moment He completely changed my prospects coming from a very modest background I would never have imagined to go to Bocconi during the specialist the young Bergamo experienced in Israel and England and carried out two unpaid internships in Milan and one in London for a big one Banca Italiana The first contract work by Isabella instead dates back to 2013 in Milan I was a technical consultant for a group The decision to leave for Switzerland in the first months Isabella works in a small startup in the first months to cover the expenses in June 2016 enters a large multinational company based in Zurich in the role of Senior Consultant over the years I have grown in this Company tells to be senior manager today the next step is the construction of my team and the promotion to Director smiles in Switzerland you can breathe international air much more than in Italy companies tend to get the best from the various cultures explains Isabella even if anyway We are talking about a backward country regarding the situation of women despite this in my company I grew up as I could have done in Italy I am recognized a level of respect by everyone that as a young woman I would not have experienced at home in Milan on the contrary Isabella has worked for two companies with a global presence but the ambi Work Authority reflected some extremely hierarchical Italian stereotypes reluctant to patriarchal innovation in Zurich, lunch hours start at 11 45 not at 13 30 tells Isabella the supermarkets are closed on Sunday and in general the shops make office hours this because many Swiss women unfortunately not They work we move above all by public transport if there is a good weather on a bike and only if you really need the car eating outside is spontaneity particularly expensive does not exist and to go out with most people you have to organize with at least 3 weeks of Advance which I find very difficult smiles Swiss wages throat to many but you have to understand that a two -room apartment in the center here costs 2 500 francs per month the health insurance you pay separately to send a child to school can cost 3 000 francs per month and the tax burden is not low as you would expect Sorace also wrote a book that collects the stories of a lost generation The life from Expat is often much more complex than how you imagine it from Italy call us brains on the run as if all we carry behind it was only our work is not Thus leaving is the easiest thing to remain then stopped in a new country for a long time becomes complicated in Zurich there are many Italians but most of them do not remain after a few years return to Italy or move elsewhere the difficulty lies in putting new Radici thinks of returning one day C is certainly the desire to live in a country where I speak well the language where I share the culture of food and most people live in spontaneous and unscheduled world, however, there are important aspects of Switzerland that today Isabella In Italy the economic condition would not find the work environment his grandparents have moved from the south to Florence his dad in ger Mania his mom in Lombardy today his parents live in Paris his sister in Amsterdam we have always been an international family for us emigrating has never been considered abnormal abroad I have become more patriot than I was in Italy he concludes how no country is Perfect makes you appreciate your more if I had to find a job that gives me the same satisfaction as I have in Zurich I could actually think of returning if not I wait for the pension
 I have not been satisfied for years at the end of the day, the stress accumulated in Italy for my work especially during the pandemic had almost killed me literally I was reborn now I don't do the bureaucrat I only do the thing I always liked to be a doctor the doctor Dr. Francesco Porro is sixty years old a wife and two children is of Calabrian origin and today he works as a pediatrician in a clinic in Zurich where he moved in September 2021 after thirty years in the Italian health system found himself in a hospital bed hit by A stroke that miraculously did not leave me permanent damage I was still in convalescence when I made contact with a pediatric clinic here in Switzerland an interview on zoom and they sent me the contract his is a story of a brain on the run that as a young man has made of everything to return from Germany to the time I returned for a matter of feeling selling the life of my emigrant parents c He would always want to be able to return to their land is the late eighties Francesco is 25 years old when he graduated in Modena voting 110 and praise I remember that I went to the doctors order to look for my first occupation but at the time of work there was not a Less than recommended, it is back in the Stuttgart area by the parents and finds work in a pediatric clinic associated with the University of Tinbinga in Esslingen a simple interview a few days of trial and I was hired but the desire to return to Italy was too strong a feature was too strong Of the emigrants I saw in Germany tell it was often to live near the station this sense of physical closeness was transformed into a mental closeness of being able to say here when I want to take the train and return to Italy, read also I live in London since 2013 and I organize removals not always leaving It is the ri He moves but wanting to do it and not trying is the worst regret for his return, Dr. Porro tries the road of the American military bases I went to work in the emergency room of the military hospital of Bad Cannstatt what I struck me was the talks made by these US soldiers who asked me little about what I actually knew how to do what would have seen in the trial period while the questions were on what I thought of the doctor's task as I saw my job and so on after three years he manages to be transferred to Pisa in the base clinic of Camp Derby then in a clinic in Florence as a general practitioner while at night he was a medical guard until 2018 until he climbs the ranking he can access the convention as a general practitioner I had finally had the agreement for General Medicine I thought I had reached tranquility a stable job and a regular life leek, however, clashes in the first Person with the National Health System today Com is set with 1500 patients no longer alive with the AFT territorial functional aggregation are the groups of doctors who seven days a week from eight in the morning to 20 00 must guarantee the protection of the health of the patients entrusted by the system Healthcare editor's doctors have become bureaucrats while the ASLs leverage to make you do the things that want to save the days spent managing budgets in addition to taking care of patients, showed how much each doctor spent who spent less received a bonus And not a little even 8 thousand euros in the year so you were incentivized to save the pediatrician, for example, the objective of reducing prescribed antibiotics took place, you took an average of prescriptions if you were taking the bonus then there are guidelines from So to follow is also a system that serves underlines I see it here too in Switzer However, here are private insurances a patient thinks and evaluates the urgency together with the doctor otherwise if you sfor your expense roof next year the insurance increases we are more free to make our decisions and we are not penalized that his departure is not It was a matter of money, the doctor clearly states if I do two accounts, since the cost of Zurich high life is although the taxation is at 12 in Switzerland there are a series of indirect expenses for which at the end of the month I remain 4 thousand francs in Italy with A little private activity I had even earned more after paying taxes read also I live in Finland since 2002 and now I am the first Italian principal in a school in the home of my home is now here that's why the arrival of the pandemic has done nothing but worsen The situation the patients called you at any time I spent most of my time on the phone was as if we doctors were an obstacle to go beyond their will, often insisted with urgencies above all the band from fifty years up because they had the exemption and did not have to pay even if not c It was no urgency and they only clogged the system is now all questioning anything about the therapies vaccines is asked less to a mechanic who repairs you the car that not to the doctor who gives you a medicine and when they were not patients who pressed came The bureaucracy vaccinated 300 patients last year and every patient complicated your life because it was necessary to do a whole series of bureaucratic passages that required hours otherwise the system did not give you other vaccines a working problem for the Italian one that is felt by many doctors the colleagues who I feel they are all at the limit in this situation who does not go out for a better working quality Try to retire and generational change is not because they have blocked specializations for years, Italy has long been a problem of lack of doctors not only those of the family as reported by all trade associations and trade unions if something will not change in ours The country the health system will not be able to withstand Francesco's does not want to be a farewell still has good intentions for his land Florence remains our house where our friendships are despite all my idea is to return in a few years and work in Italy Until the pension, however, with a different awareness that this experience has given me and that I am happy to have done
 I chose to do business in Italy because I felt the need to fully know my origins Matthew Modabber is 22 years old and was born and raised in New York as Italian American parents has decided to leave for Italy just turned 19 today directs one Chain of shops with her sister in the heart of Lombardy my family made huge sacrifices to stay in New York remembers Matthew at the fact that they are and I will always be grateful they were the ones who pushed me to apply for Italy they taught me to Having the mind open the roads to achieve a goal are infinite smiles Matthew decides to leave for Milan to study International Economics and Management at Bocconi University and it is precisely at that time that as a university student notices a deficiency within the choice of fast meals To be consumed on a lunch break reduced to pizzette sandwiches and dishes ready from here the choice to found together To his sister Venus a chain named Salad House l Italy today is very different from what we knew explains the 22 year old offers many more entrepreneurial ideas than the closed economy of once among the Italian cities Milan is the one that most has an international breath that It offers more opportunities for foreigners people are curious to discover new places and new tastes and there is the Fomo Fear of Missing Out adds Matthew attended a degree course where the 70 of the students was international and that like me he was recreating a family of friends in Italy obtaining, among other things, the recognition that the Milanese university assigns for academic excellence to those who have characterized the structure of the universities is radically different from the United States and these differences start from high school in the United States are favoring group works much more importance is given to the world of work through meetings with companies s tage and field experiences encourages the development of creative and less notionist ideas in the United States continues the young entrepreneur the taxation is less and the procedures are different in Italy there is much more bureaucracy the legislation of the labor market and the contractual forms make a lot Complicated operating, the pandemic has engraved considerably but not enough to have Matthew's projects and objectives abandoned we had to postpone the opening of 3 stores with a significant economic and moral loss despite this tried to invest to improve internal processes And the delivery the staff of the chain is almost entirely under 26 explains Matthew together with his sister Venus has also started following other projects and dealing with new companies today manages 3 between Italy and America and is manager for a startup that has already obtained 30 million dollars of loans currently living between Mila No and New York trying to take the best from these two cities tells for me the routine is very important so even when I travel or change the country I try to stick as much as possible to my pace I wake up around 6 in the morning medit for 10 minutes I drink one Shake I reply to the most urgent messages or emails and I prepare to get out of work better in the cafes that at home smiles until recently I was always in my clubs to take the lunch shift now I have a less operational role also read in London since 2013 And I organize removals leave is not always the answer but wanting to do it and not trying is the worst regret because then many Italians leave their country I think it is a vicious circle in a country where hires are so onerous for companies C is little space for Attracting and retaining talents would serve more competitiveness between Profess ionists by encouraging companies to entrepreneurial risk and therefore the possibility of taking more flexibility if it were to give advice to young Italians would be to try to meet as many people as possible of different backgrounds you never know when an opportunity from the United States will present you missing there Optimism and the cult of the client of Italy Matthew loves the warmth of people Mediterranean life the possibility of traveling to Europe so easily the variety of activities in such a little space in 10 years the young Italian entrepreneur Italus dreams of his company developed in a European context But in spite of everything I conclude I see myself contributing in the Italian entrepreneurial context
When in 2013 he started from his little village in Sardinia Jerzu Samuele Mura he was 23 years old I remember well that day I cried I was leaving my land my family my friends today almost 10 years later lives and works in London is the head of a team of 10 people all Sardinian but a nice coincidence is no parochialism smiles everything was born from a remote job I worked by Sardinia for an English transport company tells Samuele Fewi they dealt with international removals even if they were in great demand so I used the money saved To open a site, record the name and thanks to some old customers who followed me I started with the first move, the logo tells the whole of the region's flag but instead of the dying four houses Samuele left its land with the promise to return at least 3 times the year friends and the family did not believe I would really go away some thought sar He returned immediately smiles to carry on a startup and making entrepreneurship in the UK is not simple at the beginning of England is tough it does not give you anything and it is a bit like if he tried to test you often adds Samuele you make the mistake of thinking that only to be Party you have to receive something in return instead it is precisely the opposite there is a lot of competition and you have to earn every single step fortunately being very meritocratic if you give us inside you start very soon to see the fruits the day revolves around its two main activities that of Entrepreneur and the most recent one of a sports agent The base is in Oval a more or less central area from there Samuele moved to the office in Highbury or goes around for some meetings the teams that I have created over time allow me to carry on both without them it would not be possible to read too After abroad still in Italy to open my company I seem to have never gone from it, that's why I chose to return to the United Kingdom according to Samuele's experience an employee costs the company only about 13 of his net salary an abyss compared to that who costs an employee to an Italian company, taxation for companies is then lower but above all more slender I still remember with a smile every time in the first months of the company's life we ??received checks with reimbursements from the government office responsible for the Collection of taxes we had paid more VAT or more taxes than everything without having requested anything certain of England is not the country of toys adds there are defects and disadvantages but taxation and bureaucracy are certainly not among these at the same time the Italian training it is certainly of a high level responds but especially compared to the UK it is still done To too much theory and little practice for Samuel many Italians decide to leave the country in order not to be judged limited by speeches linked to the age of the social class to meritocracy c is then the desire not to want to settle for wanting to make themselves in their own field adds the Sardinian entrepreneur thinks Often to what his life would have been if he had not chosen to leave sometimes he is almost afraid to think about it I would not have been able to do all the experiences to combine contacts to grow my company I would not be working in the world of football in close contact with the Champions that as a child I was watching on TV I would certainly have got away but most likely I would have had the huge regret of not having tried it also read work in one of the best US research centers from Italy they tell me you will see that you no longer come back but I still hope you are wrong an adventure that of the name of the company editor's note started with a simple intuition and which today organizes removals for destinations such as Australia United States and China after 10 years of houses emptied filled boxes and memories transported around the world Samuele's dream is to open a Office in the United States, perhaps in New York or Los Angeles, the future of these days seems difficult to imagine us even only the next year smiles the staff for young Italians is to consider all the choices well I would like to tell them that the answer is not always starting Starting is not always the right thing that is the worst thing that one can have is the regret of not having tried often we do not do something for the simple fact that you are afraid of failure to fail in some cases is the most beautiful thing you can Do
The departure is the first for the United States at sixteen guests of a family between the forests of Oregon C is the return a year later with a look forever changed on life and on the possibilities that abroad can offer but also to remove there are The nostalgia of the house is loneliness, friendships the suitcases to be closed to open up always to be redone the ceremony to celebrate San Nicola Sinterklaas typical of the Netherlands where instead of embarking the table for imminent Christmas you eat a soup the student holidays in which the guests are They sit in a circle in Amsterdam works like this and the awareness of having become foreign time in a new land all this we read in Michela Grasso's book The future cannot wait because my generation is forced to start by deagostini portrait and voice Of a phenomenon so well known as to have now almost legendary traits the brains fleeing from Italy not only professional You but also very young guys who choose to go abroad to study and work some others do not seek that future that inside the national borders has blurred or far away Michela Grasso is one of them after the year in Oregon has returned to Italy it was Graduated and later he left for the Holland where he enrolled at the University of Amsterdam choosing political sciences, social networks know her as the mind of the SpaghectoPolitics account over 230 thousand followers and the photo of Silvio Berlusconi with Bandana as an image of the profile A NATO project reads in the Book to tell Italy abroad is seen as this mystical country where you eat well is warm but that it would work better if it was not the Italians to govern Voices collected in the text that are joined to the personal experience of the author someone has started In search of a lifest lifestyle far from discrimination like Luca others choose the Via dell'Anno sabbatico at 43 years for example Andrea Tianzi instead decided to return to his origins and from Italy he returned to Shanghai in China and Michela reports his own Journey starting from the beginning arrives in his accommodation in July 2018 with two huge suitcases and a ramp of stairs in front of seventeen roommates with two bathrooms and a kitchen the first months pass in the movement of independence that I had never known the beauty remains but takes place Behind the difficult the loneliness of integration despite the common European matrix recalls the dinners who have passed in silence because it dense with references to specific topics of local culture then known step by step and dinner after dinner the black contracts in a restaurant for tourists paid 5 35 euro per hour to work all day between the suspicions and looks of those who consider GL The Italians the usual lazy eternal the disorientation Michela is neither immigrated nor expat when I was exploited in a restaurant in the center of Amsterdam my employers as my colleagues considered me an immigrant when instead I was in a university classroom to discuss of international politics with the professors I was seen as an expat and precisely the university gives his experience the breath that was looking for above all in comparison with the other Dutch and international students and with the professors the lessons are a dialogue that unites the two parts listening Never miss the nostalgia of the house is shared with the other guys and mitigated with the recipes that the grandmother sends them from Italy by writing at the end of the messages hello beautiful the book is dedicated to her now Michela Grasso has started again for France where she will remain For a few months the question that sooner or later reaches all the brains on the run strikes it in full t He will adorn in Italy he tries to respond among the conclusive stripes if I think of the sea of ??my Liguria to the hazel trees that dot the Irpinia of my memories and to the chaos pulsating in Milan that is never silent to me and I feel Italian up to the core but They do not believe those who tell her that if they love her country, she must necessarily be left, it is not only a whim behind those closed suitcases and empty rooms there are months perhaps years of dreams of ideas and rethinking only by closing the door of my room from For the last time I managed to understand what was out and how much the young people really count for Italy and I hope that these skills that I slowly acquire at abroad I can take them home one day View this post on Instagram a post shared by spaghettipolitics spaghettipolitics
 Returning to Italy one day perhaps when I retire Stefano Fasciani is 39 years old and is an electronic engineer of Roman origins in 2007 he left his work full -time and indefinitely in the capital to go abroad Singapore direction no one forced me to go Via I just wanted to experience and grow from a professional and human point of view three -year and specialist degree to Tor Vergata in Electronic Engineering Stefano for 4 years has worked as an engineer in a company in Rome over 15 years between Singapore at the National University of Singapore and the Nanyang Technological University and Emirates Arabi today covers the role of Associate Professor at the Department of Musicology of the University of Oslo where he deals with Music Technology in Norway tells Stefano gives himself much more importance to private life and family compared to work some differences make them the reads but the vast difference make your colleagues Their cultural background and their aptitude tells the fact that even after abroad still in Italy to open my company I seem to have never gone to it that's why I chose to return to the level of legislation and taxation Norway and Italy for Stefano are Very similar to Singapore, however, you pay less taxes but the state gives you nothing especially if you are a foreign healthcare is guaranteed by a private insurance that pays you the employer the pension does not exist if you want to send the children to school you have to pay in the Emirates United Arabs you earn your path well is recognized and enhanced especially if you come from university level the taxation on income is zero but you have no continuous public service the professor you pay also to go for a complaint from the police send your son to school Costa more than pag there are also taxes in these countries you have nothing guaranteed there is no welfare if you lose the work there is no subsidy you go for Stefano the Italian training is of excellent level the courses and the exams are more difficult to basically the 18th in Italy is a Vote that students try to avoid yet represents the 60 of the minimum threshold to pass the exam here in Norway in theory we pass with 41 elsewhere with the 50 this tells you so much on the level of Italy adds when Stefano studied engineering in Italy at the level of workshops Infrastructures to do research, on the other hand, were not many resources recalls due to pandemic in Norway between March and April 2020 have closed the university in a precaution despite very few infections, teaching has been distorted the emergency situation has generated an additional amount of work by removing time in search explains how coordinator of a Master Cross Camp program Us in Music Communication and Technology adds Stefano already made a lot of online with our students and colleagues divided between Oslo and Trondheim was simple for us to migrate to 100 on the platforms on the net, read Italian research is hungry does not have funds in Chile is continuously Movement here is how I work at the Southern European Observatory Stefano does not absolutely share the rhetoric of the brain escape in the research area explains the brains must circulate it is right that those who study have the opportunity and the opportunity to go circular from Rome to Zurich to Sidney in the academic field Diversity experiences abroad open your mind what is missing are foreign researchers who come because it is known that in Italy the language is often spent in research represents a problem even if many universities are today Nizlendo to have specialist degrees in English to attract foreign students as well as the system of competitions The problem of the Italian University is the method of hiring in all other countries where I have worked there are no competitions you choose the figure that serves the department most if I have A doctorate position I write a specific work announcement the profile and select with an external commission the candidate the competition leads you to assume the best at the absolute level but not what you need at that moment a advice to young people abroad will face problems whose culture and way of thinking is different from your becoming open and tolerant with the others responds the Roman professor to get out of the bubble and dare to risk without fear by being out of you realize how many positive things there are in Italy who is often and willingly ends up To criticize everything smiles Stefano if I had not left concludes the To my life it would have been much more boring and without satisfaction
 One foot in one country one foot in another I find my condition very happy as it was free as it wrote the philosopher Descartes in 1648 explaining his condition as a traveler who did not fossilize in one place but went in search of happiness between foreign and village Natio the quote is by Andrea Bardin fifty -two -year -olds in Schio in the province of Vicenza teacher of the history of political thought at Brooke University of Oxford in England passionate about philosophy and politics has started teaching in high schools of Vicenza to land in 2015 in the English universities before I did The warehouse worker or I worked in the community then I taught in high schools until I started a doctorate in 2007 in philosophy and history of political thought at the University of Padua was what I wanted because I like to study and know later came a doctorate to the Brunel University in London and after a few years as pre -premiere I take Oxford to also read my life in Mexico for ten years I love Italy but remember us researchers only when we get important results finished the doctorate in Padua at the age of 40 Andrea found himself with many question marks and an age he said Inadequate to access the universities in Italy I would not have found work after their studies, young people have to queue rely on a professor or a research institute and wait for years I was already forty years old and I would not have been able to find a place is not what I call a Open system thus on the suggestion of a colleague pushed himself not far from London where he found a chair was not simple I was precarious for a long time even in England there were difficulties I lost a competition and therefore without a fixed place I had to return For a few months in Vicenza in one there CEO but there are also meritocratic criteria to be recognized and finding a place in universities, first of all you have to teach satisfactorily then it is essential to publish articles for important English magazines relating to your area I specialized in the study of Simondon French philosopher of the twentieth century that he offered An interesting approach to social relationships from here the choice to stay in the United Kingdom have welcomed me well I found colleagues available including some compatriots and in addition you breathed a multiculturalism that I like born in 1969 Andrea is one of the many brains to flee a sign of contradiction of a Italy unable to retain its talents, however, I see this problem differently from what you usually explain the teacher at IlFattoquotidiano it does not concern so much the boys who go abroad how much the fact that there is no reverse flow do not arrive young enough in Italy the replacement is missing Which would allow you to learn and grow at academic level, you cannot think of a local brain market you have to think in European perspective, England has widened other horizons of my European colleagues would never go to work in a country like Italy where there are difficulties and gender differences in terms of salary and extra treatment in the UK no one takes care of the color of the skin unfortunately cannot be said to be the same in Italy and the salary I earn a third more of my Italian colleagues the salary is adjusted according to Inflation and then there is also the seniority shot the union is very strong and with Brexit the jobs have increased for which if a teacher is fired more easily finds an employment elsewhere the problem of Italy in education does not invest in research and backward In the school system it produces a lot of intellectual work but does not have the structures and contribution levels to exploit Read it even after a year in Denmark I could already pay 1 200 euros for rent now I work in LEGO in Italy they would tell me that I have not seen from beyond the sleeve our country, however, also has some light in some respects in Italy some things are better The role of both school and university professor is perceived a little better and the public school despite being falling is still a strong sector here if they dream of a public system and free the value of Italy is to know how to produce intelligence but these must then participate At the circulation they should not be kept on this continuous journey Andrea has now found his balance just like Descartes I would not be able to fossilize myself in a country to have a single home would be an obsession I feel at home both when I land in England and when I see the mountains and relatives in Veneto a Vicenza I can embrace my family the ex -goalkeeper of the Larossi Vicenza in Serie A The striker's daughter in the highest women's championship and as a good provincial road drinking something with friends
 After the maturity I moved to the United Kingdom to study experimental physics although in Italy there are excellent universities due to the scarcity of the funds, the theoretical physics that requires less resources this is one of the reasons for which I am abroad Chiara Decaroli is 30 years old is preferred And a village in the Piedmontese countryside is originally from Cigliano today is physical at the UK S National Quantum Computing Center of Oxford left Italy when he was 19 years old lives and works abroad before moving to the UK to study physics at the University of Edinburgh Chiara He attended the classical high school with Ivrea scientific mathematical address I loved the high school years I think that Italian high schools are of the highest level compared to the foreign ones and that they give solid bases on many subjects adds in his academic path Chiara has studied in Marseille Karlsruhe and Barcelona and then end the thesis in Zurich where he stopped for Dr. or in quantum physics at the end of the first three years of graduation Chiara had already carried out three internships one in Edinburgh one in Hamburg and one at CERN in Geneva experiences that helped me better understand what type of physics I liked and exposed me to the environments of research in various parts of Europe, Italian universities should give more possibilities to carry out internship periods during the university path paid properly today Chiara lives together with her husband in Oxford where he directs the innovation activities necessary to bring quantum technology from a stage of Development in the laboratory to a commercial product in general explains the pandemic has engraved enormously on the situation of research due to the limited access to the most limited workshops and opportunities in interacting with colleagues in Great Britain the university year begins in September and ends in May C is only one appeal and there is no concept of refusing a V oto and redo the exam as in Italy smiles this allows students to have 4 months in summer in which they usually carry out work experiences in both academic and industrial workshops the differences compared to Italy are felt is not a mystery for example that in Switzerland wages are very high and the very low taxes in most European countries and also in UK clear the salaries of researchers are clearly barely sufficient to cover the expenses at the University of Oxford explains one of the most expensive cities in the country where a room Between 500 and 1000 pounds per month, doctoral students receive about 13 000 pounds l year considering that the doctorals are girls and boys around 25 30 years it is really difficult to think of putting something aside for the future, let alone have children and in Italy does not yet exist a truly meritocratic system accordingly the intelligent people who see OPPO Runity after opportunities to end up less capable but better connected people, I am grown, I think that all European countries and not only are very happy with this unhappy Italian situation adds so that there are continuously highly qualified and truly bright people who have had to spend anything in forming them Returning to Italy for Chiara is the dream in the drawer for now has never received proposals while continuing to receive constant requests and job offers from various countries between Europe and America, research is a huge heritage for a country forms experts and pushes progress if The political class does not take note of it and consequently not allocating sufficient funds, the nation remains behind a stagnant situation to young people would advise you to make its voices heard the Italian situation is very difficult for young people looking for work lifting your voice make yours heard Opinions to the political class the future is yours Not them before I conclude it is true if I had not started I would have been closer to my family and my friends but abroad I always felt valued I have practically never had to look for work the job looked for me and I have never had inadequate wages
 The decision to go away from Italy to continue to do research quickly taken him if I had thought about it on a little more likely I would not have had the courage to leave everything and go to Mexico Rosanna Bonasia Sorcere of Apulian origins he left Italy in 2010 Today in Mexico City is a professor at the National Polytechnic Institute where he coordinates the project that concerns the application of the Super Computer for the calculation of damage caused by Solid Fluid Interaction Processes, Italy smiles could do much more for the Rosanna research is 44 years old and The Specialist The Doctorate and the Master in thermophalidodynamics in Rome was born in Bari after graduating in Geological Sciences, he moved to the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology in Naples doing his research in the field of computational dynamic fluid arrived in Mexico I worked on the analysis of the dispersion of ashes of active volcanoes and on the calculation of the RISch I reported eleven years ago, Mexico invested a lot in the research recalls Rosanna was a country active from this point of view there was so much to do and study and my first years there were very stimulating then with the passage of time it realized that Mexico is similar to Italy from many points of view I have experienced the same problems as many of my colleagues who have remained in Italy and were precarious for a long time and yet the first post -doctorate bag in Mexico explains was much higher than the search allowance that I received in Italy today Rosanna deals with finding solutions that minimize the damage caused by floods and tsunami calculation, the energies that can be extracted from the ocean currents I approach everything that has to do with fluids by applying numerical models its contract perhaps does not exist in Italy an organism similar to the Italian CNR has hired me to lend myself to a university institution I perform the functions of I a researcher and I use an incentive that is an extra compared to my salary that grows as much as my scientific production grows in Mexico, pandemic has had a strong impact explains Rosanna on the entire educational sector at national level in the institution where For example, he has not yet started the lessons in the presence of Mexico City is enormous in general I put about an hour to reach my office I answer the emails and I receive the students or I do lessons in the afternoon I dedicate it to the study and work of my articles The relationship with Italy for Rosanna is that of a teenage daughter with a parent I love my country but we are always in contrast I can not take things as they are passively accepting the events l Italy adds should spend a lot more money for workshops wage projects of researchers often the work that we researchers do is recognized only as Do we get important results such as the recent Nobel Prize for the physics of Giorgio Parisi Rosanna recalls the sleepless nights to prepare the exams that lasted hours professors and demanding directors we have studied with rigorous and complete programs The university training of my generation is of the highest level yet continues Many of us when they decide to return collide with a new rock the national scientific qualification that forces you to insert you in a given scientific category despite our paths abroad are often multidisciplinary at this moment Rosanna is in Bari to carry out a sabbatical year of Research at the Polytechnic I could have chosen to do this year of research elsewhere but I decided to go home because I was missing to go back to Italy, he gave me back strength and stimuli to do so much more despite all my experiences abroad in Italy I feel sure I found On my return one Kindness that I did not remember a little prejudices perhaps I also admitted to them that I am reclosing myself to the young Rosanna recommends not to be discouraged there are always the negative moments for all generations warns her life cannot imagine it without the search I sincerely hope to have Still the possibility of doing research when I am 55 years old the search made me free I would not have been able to do anything else in my life I probably could have concluded but I would not have been happy
 As a student in Denmark between scholarship and part time I took about 2 thousand euros per month and after a year from the first job I could afford a rent of 1200 euros if I returned to Italy today I would probably be considered as a thirty -year -old young man and not a professional with experience Valentina Camilletti Marche is an example of the Erasmus generation after an experience at the Copenhagen Business School in 2013 decided to return to Denmark for a master's degree in Diversity and Change Management and still a student finds the first job in the Maersk commercial company today works at the LEGO headquarters in Billund The unique non -Danish of his team I left an indefinite contract for a life project with my partner in Italy I would never have done it read also Italian research is hungry has no funds in Chile is in constant movement here is how work Or at the Austral European Observatory when he explained that he wanted to continue his studies in Europe they told her where you think you are going with this European mind you are still a girl but with her first job she perceived a triple figure compared to what she would take mine in Italy Studies to the CBS concerned a discipline close to the field of human resources that manages the inclusiveness within the company on various levels by passing from the sustainability of the management of environmental risks to gender remunerative equality in Italy was nothing similar during the first half of the second Year enters an important commercial company although I had a student contract here there is no time to take the time to make photocopies you have to learn quickly remember but on the other they are never really fixed at least in the private way as a CE RTA rhetoric could make you think when I needed the days for me no one has ever denied them and working flexibility gives security just if you have to make a personal choice I moved to a new city leaving Copenhagen to follow a life choice with My partner leaving an indeterminate for a determined because you have a little security of having the Nordic mentality of social status is still rooted although there is a change in place with the new generations and there is no shortage of disparities C is a wage difference of gender too here too Although in a smaller way that in Italy explains Valentina to the fact but companies like Maersk or Lego constantly make internal analyzes to solve these problems, however, in general women still perceive a slightly lower salary one of his tasks is precisely that of file these differences within the company in my case it happened that the Danes are Nissero promoted more easily than foreigners this happened to me too after a couple of years in Maersk I pointed it out and adjusted the salary but it was possible thanks to the Danish colleagues who pointed out to me the LEGO Group where he works now Although it is an international company, it has recently started to change mentality regarding internal communication are the first of my non -Danish team and we are managing to pass the concept so when you are in an official situation you have to speak in English then explains I speak Danish but it is not a linguistic problem the opening of a company and not being perched on limited dynamics are important messages for those who are outside something that we should also improve in Italian companies read also in London I have become associated professor in 5 years none National qualification BA He is a good CV but the patients are less followed that in Denmark the cost of living is notoriously high as in the other Scandinavian countries it is well known at least one third of the salary for rent do not go to dinner several times a week if you go to an average restaurant High go there maximum once a month tells Valentina I think it is to keep the salaries so high of those who do more humble jobs because they too earn well a sort of equal income from if you enter a house of a Danish you will see the same service of dishes of the neighbor even if one is a worker and the other is a lawyer call him Janteloven a custom according to which the individual who tries to differentiate himself from the group is seen negatively in short, one must not pull it too much you see it also in the aesthetic often dress dark colors themselves brands of clothes of electronics and so on but the younger generations try to depart from them tend to be more in Dividualisti affirms Valentina, the fourth wave of Coronavirus did not spare even the virtuous Denmark where the tests for Covid are free of free who with his 77 vaccinated with a complete cycle reached 45 983 contacts between 5 and 11 December although the dead were Less than a third respect the peak of January I had Covid last year I was not in the hospital but I had brackets from Long Covid here is perhaps a thing that I miss from Italy paradoxically is our health care with us a doctor of base can dedicate you more time and you can ask him more things while here being the doctors paid also based on the performance if you ask for an appointment for one thing and you want to ask for an opinion for another you must resume appointment some stereotypes, however, they are true of our country I miss the Opening and warmth of the people here put us a bit from this point of view after years in addition to the lack of family and friends t I realize that you have lost many important moments of the life of the people you keep more read also I also live in Finland since 2002 and now I am the first Italian principal in a school in the home of my home is now here that's why Valentina remains confident about the future too Of our country that the pandemic has speeded up a process of change is undeniable we are much more connected the generations today are different from those of our parents, however, it affirms Italy for now is not a country for young people or women here is not a hierarchy for which If one is older, he has the right to pass in front of you or is considered more as long as I want to focus on work I will not return to Italy unless things change
 Here there is a movement an explosion in the research a continuous opening of places by university teachers I started on July 27, 2017 in Chile I realized my dream as a child Claudia Paladini Pugliese is astronoma in Santiago in Chile his cheerful and clear voice comes from the observatory In the Atacama desert at 2 700 meters in height, I love it but often boiling me the blood I would be a liar if I didn't say Claudia went away from Italy in 2007 when she moved to Austria to the University of Vienna for the doctorate of Research was my personal challenge reminded the first time the first time he had the feeling of leaving from Italy was a few years earlier precisely when I moved from Leverano my village in the province of Lecce to Padua to attend the university was A bigger jump than not going from Padua to Vienna C was the linguistic barrier of dialects C was the transition from the country to the city C It was the travels of hope in the espresso 943 Trieste Lecce C was the distrust of those who saw me as a lower being only because I came from the south fortunately not so many it was the late 90s certainly now things are different before winning the place as an astronoma In the Operational Staff of the Very Large Telescope of the Eso European Observatory Eso in Italy Claudia did only occasional student jobs when I started the doctorate in Austria the first thing that my Italian friends pointed out was the difference in salary the fact that I I had the contributions paid for the thirteenth and fourteenth pension and a health insurance and they struggled to arrive at the end of the month with the dependent families other difference is the way in which the job offers and competitions are presented to me always fall asleep at the third line of the announcement Those who write the calls of Italian competitions Claudia smiles smiles and hopes that the situation And it has changed over the years I see an effort to improve and make steps forward adds C it is hungry in Italian research there are no funds and it is not a phrase made there is hunger in research and this hunger is also expanding to other European countries today his own work is divided between the service at the astronomical observatory and the research in Santiago the city is great and offers a lot of life in Chile I love weekends outside the door from Santiago in one hour you are at the sea and in one hour you are in the mountains nature is crazy To get to the Observatory, instead, 6 7 hours of travel are needed, the observations last from 8 to 14 days at night you look at the sunset as per ritual all together and you sit at the command posts to start observing small break in the middle of the night and then observations Until morning when you go to sleep in Santiago, the Lockdown was taken very seriously since March 2020 the curfew with some oscillation of times in March 2021 was triggered tato introduced the Pase de Movilidad which allows a minimum of freedom to those who have vaccinated explains Claudia for almost two years the conferences The observations all the interactions have moved online with the infections and the very high number of vaccinated slowly we are returning to meet us Always strictly with mask and green pass I return yes I would like to go back to living in Italy one day probably for the pension or maybe a little before who knows the astronoma replies very much I miss Salento my land my sea I need at least two weeks per year a 40 degrees smiles when I think of life in Italy I clash with the bureaucracy see the limbo in which I would find myself if I returned only because it was vaccinated outside of Europe with the slowness of some processes use of the ATM and the credit card digitization with some cunning that does not want make the receipt with the precariousness of my peers with those who complain to Bringing those who blame the state and strong powers who continues to say that in Italy everything works very well and has never set foot out of the door in 10 years after the Pandemia Claudia imagines themselves more and more in contact with the new generations to do research for She means working on her data in the office but also participating in conferences go to the observatory to speak to young people explain in connection with the girls of a school around the world that everything is possible and then go home to eat pizza on the sofa with mine Comrade watching a movie with the lights of Santiago behind and the sea of ??Porto Cesareo in the head waiting for next summer
 When I go back to Italy the first days in Licata are always beautiful but then when the routine begins I understand that many things have changed and that I have changed I can no longer accept certain attitudes the absence of services or the inertia of many people Fabio Castiglione 37 years is A Sicilian andrologist and urologist for 5 years has lived and works in London where he is considered one of the top experts in his field and has received a recognition as the best European andrologist Fabio moved to 19 years of age in Milan where he graduated in Medicine and Surgery in 2009 At the San Raffaele University and the Specialization in Urology then the PhD at the Katholieke University Leuven in Belgium and a year as a voluntary surgeon spent in India before settling in London definitively during the university I started attending the ALL HUMANITAS plastic surgery department where the stem cells of the fat were used to model the scars Hypertrophic reminds Fabio to the fact it there I had an intuition that changed my life to use the stem cells to treat a pathology of the penis called La Peyronie's disease I was 24 years old Fabio returns to San Raffaele where he starts working on his idea in the urology department During the specialization I had the opportunity to go to Sweden for 6 months and then to the United States to the Johns Hopkins for another 6 to learn the animal models of sexual medicine after 3 years of white nights, the results are published attracting great interest on the day in which I went away from Italy I remember it well I celebrated my 30 years abroad smiles Fabio who since 2016 is at the University College of London Hospital Uclh where today it is consultant in andrology and professor in urology in the health field the differences are clear in the United Kingdom There is much more job offer and also the way of working is very different in Italy hospitals ni explains Fabio there is a very rigid almost military pyramidal system where in Capo C it is the primary and under all the others at every level as a doctor feel the weight of your superiors in the United Kingdom instead there is no primary every professional works as a single unit the cases This type of organization is discussed in a special meeting in special meetings has positive consequences, the atmosphere is much more relaxed and in short, it is the same concludes the Sicilian andrologist the system is more meritocratic and democratic but the patient is less followed the academic career in the UK It is then much faster I have become associated professor in 5 years there is no national scientific qualification you just have to have a good curriculum and it is the university that Fabio assumes you directly, however, keeps us to clarify that his vision is limited despite having worked in many hospitals also abroad I have never seen a place where the PA Ziente is followed as at the San Raffaele Department of Urology in Milan directed by Prof Montarsi adds Fabio's day in London starts at 5 30 work from 9 to 16 then the clinic where he sees patients until 20 two days a week are dedicated to Research on Saturdays and Sundays are entirely for the family the hospital is 5 minutes walk from home often I eat with mine for me this is the biggest luxury smiles in London the rents are very dear as well as the cost of the houses for the rest is similar to Milan the taxes are high but also the salaries in the United Kingdom for 6 months at the beginning of 2021 Fabio worked as a health worker in intensive care my work as the andrologist was not necessary during the pandemic and the managers relocated me the patients Not a usual thing for a doctor I have never felt so useful in my life I have seen many people die never get used to death Brexit Instead he is having influence on the staff we have problems of doctors do not find them no longer come in the United Kingdom so easily but we have an extreme in 10 years Fabio Si Immagine happy as it is now to return to Italy it would be like moving to a new one country I think about it more out of curiosity, however, not for a real need in Italy they would give me more space and more freedom, but I love London and my wife and my brother today they live here, but I am sure I owe everything to Italy at Prof Montarsi and al Despite the training system, despite having more opportunities in Milan, I decided to stay here in London I am no longer afraid of getting involved smiles in addition to his job in the Fabio hospital as a doctor in a clinic for Italians in the United Kingdom where you visit and help dozens daily of compatriots this makes me feel less guilty of not having returned to San Raffaele is concluded how to give something back
 On October 30, 2002 I landed in Helsinki with a suitcase a room in a studied for a few weeks no job a stagger friend of my parents little stuff in a rather expensive country but still a precious help Rosario Fina is 46 years old is originally from Battipaglia Salerno and lives between Tampere and Helsinki is the first Italian principal in a Finnish school, Italy is my home smiles but then the point comes where it is a right and also a duty to themselves a solid certainty of Rosario's academic path to themselves. The study of the Finnish language and literature in that I have always excellent for both votes and timing without losing a blow reminds the fact in 2002 a few months after the graduation Rosario arrives in Finland to conclude his research and complete the thesis will remain there For almost 20 years in Finland I have been welcomed well this does not mean that everything has always been roses and f Iori or that there have never been difficulties explains Finland gave me non -free opportunities put there on a tray but to be able to grow that they can do important things the constant and planned hard work in these parts is repaid today Rosario works in Roovesi one Small community surrounded by greenery surrounded by a three sports fields Sports Fields Municipal Library The Music Aules Draw the workshops for the Sciences The Kitchens for the Domestic Economy The Palaghiaccio open to the School for Winter Sports and the Nature which is an expansion of the classrooms after Years of study despite two qualifications and qualification to teaching in Finland in Pocket Rosario has enrolled in the academic path to become a school manager but in the end you do not have the place nor do you enter a ranking you enabled you are on the market skills Curriculum experiences they do the rest are the first Italian principal of this institute and a lot Probably the only one or one of the first foreigners in Finland says with a pinch of pride differences compared to the world of work what first comes to mind is the trust that you have towards those who work and the autonomy in performing their functions the possibility continues Rosario to be able to move freely within an agreed space but with flexible structures following shared rules the days are never the same wake up at 6 work from 7 to 17 meetings and meetings with teachers students families A principal in Finland is like a company director With great responsibilities, the pandemic here did not have the same drama as Italy but left a deep mark especially in young people had an important impact on school structures leading to the reorganization of the factual pedagogical practices in one night what has always aroused a strong admiration In Rosario it is the enormous sense of to public affairs of the common interest, the almost sacred way of performing a public function as an expression of a service for the community created for everyone with the resources of all this secular liturgy of work and the common good are a really beautiful thing that in the years I have learned to appreciate more and more deeply continues this does not mean that they never take place disservices or that everything always works and in any case specifies the wage differences with Italy exist and even in taxation in Italy I have always worked during the studies but never with an insurance or a Contribution nor a salary that can be defined as this dramatic thing is that this happens not only to young people but also to those who live in Italy to those who have a family the secret of Nordic well -being Rosario explains it with the sense of belonging to society e The tendent to the common good at the moment to return is not a hypothesis that the principal thinks not in plan stabi The Italy My little Italy made up of family and friends of the school in Battipaglia of walks in Salerno di Sole and light -heartedness remains a part of the heart and this is enough for the young Italians Rosario would say to be open to the new that he has memory of the past of being brave To experience without being afraid I can return quite often twice the year to return is nice to leave is sweet and sour then I put foot in Finland and I think that the house is often it comes to mind I conclude a saying of my parts that makes more or less so who lives hoping dies desperate
He left an indefinite place in public health accepting the offer of a PhD in Belgium and moved to Brussels but I found myself doing what I was doing in Italy he says to the IlFtofatotidiano It Chiara feel twenty -ninth century of Castell Arquato Piacenza a degree In Brescia in medical biotechnology I discovered too late that I had ended there only because there was a place as a laboratory place if I had known before if he had known before Chiara would never have left Italy and so two years later he chose to return because It is not all pink and flowers that offers abroad, on the contrary, they have not expressed interest in my project in the oncological field confidates Chiara for two years because of the bad management of my project the work assigned to me was the laboratory technician to follow other projects Companies or of interest of my representatives at the expense of mine while she was there for a doctor or in biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences I was not even assigned to the supervisor that must have every doctorate as a student and so that two years ago he had not hesitated to leave I was confident that with a curriculum like mine I did not miss any medical biotechnologist competence seven years of work in the oncological field to manage clinical and preclinical research projects becoming a reference figure for doctors on the consultancy of genomics read even after abroad still in Italy to open my company I seem to have never gone to it that's why I chose To return despite the work experience in the most important research center of Belgium has been disappointing Chiara does not deny it not only for the salary aspect, the PhD students in Belgium are among the most paid in Europe nothing comparable with Italy but above all for enrich Professional and personal himento had during the two -year period I learned two languages ??and had the opportunity to discover work skills that I didn't think I had I was sorry so much not to have concluded the doctorate but this experience gave me the opportunity to obtain a prominent position in Italy that I have not been able to refuse from moreover, it also admits Chiara to my age, you cannot waste too much time will now be hired by a Turin company that does not ask for experience but looks at the curriculum and will give her the opportunity to form directly in the company I will learn from scratch Profession in a reality that will take into account my scientific background applied to research I will deal with clinical experiments in the Cardiology and Surgery fields to the Italian and European authorities as the Ministry of Health AIFA and EMA and I will be a reference figure for pharmaceutical companies e hospitals involved in projects in order to test new drugs or available Medici c is so much to learn confident the biologist but I find this new work very stimulating and great responsibility for a lot of meritocracy on the clear theme is explicit is led to think that Italy is not meritocratic and instead the foreign countries for example of the northern Europe are not so the only difference are the major resources that outside Italy are dedicated to research two years in Belgium throughout the first particularly difficult on the social level I arrived a month before the pandemic I was alone and for long periods not I was able to return to Italy I was now starting to create some social life I will mind not so much to live Belgium without restrictions
 I would like to make of Italy a model for the whole of Europe Nikolaus Widmann is 28 years old is South Tyrolean by birth and Berlin by adoption has decided to return to Italy to found his company is called Irewa and it is a company for the energy transition based in Bolzano sincerely I never feel like that South Tyrolean Dad and Venetian mother smiles after the classical high school in Bolzano Nikolaus continued his studies in Holland in economics and computer science at the Maastricht University School of Business and Economics I grew up in a reality between Italian culture and The German one reminds the fact since he frequented Nikolaus high schools had clear how important it was to experience abroad to expand my horizons and see the opportunities that the world offers also because we live in a system of economies interconnected at European level e Global it is also for this reason that he has decided to go to study In Holland in Germany in 2014 Nikolaus at 22 years of age joined one of the main German energy engineering companies first as a trainee and then as responsible for digitization in 2017 creates a spin off of the company for which in the meantime it also deals of the development of international markets in particular in Austria and above all Italy and when the company was acquired by a large international group of 600 million euros in turnover, the new shareholders asked me to remain and develop the business in Austria and Italy so in 2020 ISWA was also born in Tunisia, my wife and I have become entrepreneurs the Italy that I love fitted in a bureaucracy without vision Nikolaus returned to Italy in Bolzano where today a team of 25 people my roots have always kept me linked to my country I have to what Doing with managers who on average have twice my age smiles the energy transition is a challenge to win with seriousness is not enough to tell the fairy tale of sustainability but interventions are needed with impacts on the long period continues I commit a lot but I enjoy saying that I like to face New challenges and in the company we motivate each other to the ambition to become one of the main companies of sustainable energy solutions in Italy, even after a life abroad, I decided to return to Italy elsewhere is not always better that's why Nikolaus is convinced that The Italian university education is of a high level I often feel that the connection with the world of work and the company should be strengthened is true in my university experience abroad we have worked a lot on real cases in collaboration with companies And this has allowed me to connect the theory with the practice today Nikolaus is the most 'CEO within the large international group which is part of his company to make innovation for him means constantly rethinking his models to optimize them to commit themselves every day for Improve to be inspired by what happens around us but with constant attention to sustainability if it were to give advice to young Italians here is after his experience would be precisely to remain linked to their roots and confront the world but also aspire to reach goals ambitious not to give up learning from errors to combine personal success with the well -being of society and the environment what this young manager pushed to return to Italy from Berlin honestly I don't feel like having ever left responds alive to Berlin but I feel at home both in Italy that in Austria and Germany e In this sense, I consider me a European citizen has ever thought how it would have been life if it had not started I would have had less chance of confronting realities that move internationally replies in short, I would have had difficulty understanding how the protagonists of my sector move for Nikolaus L Italia is a fantastic creative country full of opportunities, however, I recognize that it is not always easy and that many people decide to leave because they find better economic conditions in other countries
 After my studies I looked for a job but I only received waste I felt guilty and I started to depress me I was gainhed and I saw everything black today I resumed the smile I make projects I have a clearer picture of the man who want to be this push but I have it Found outside of Italy Tancredi Vella 30 -year -old from Ospitaletto in the province of Brescia today lives and works in Malta where he deals with the risk management and application of the rules for a consultancy company shortly after graduating from Law at the University of Brescia Tancredi started a send curriculum like many young graduates and like many of them he found the doors closed everywhere after a year I managed to find an internship in a banking consultancy company in Milan tells in the meantime I had started a master in risk management I took 800 euros per month impossible Live us in a city like Milan so Tancredi decides to look up and start at F are applications throughout Europe, an important international savings management company in Dublin responds to him offers him another internship but this time with a salary that allowed me not only to live but to save something also read the competition in China is also in China is Fierce but I can do the job for which I studied universities want to attract foreigners qualified with the arrival of Covid the world stops Trancredi returns to Italy but now what I had seen in Dublin did not entice me to remain an awareness that will lead him to take a Air ticket for Valletta when a well -known financial consultancy company makes him a permanent contract nobody internship now I have a salary with which I can make projects for my future but it is not just a matter of money both here that I could in Dublin. manage de The budget projects nobody made me weigh the 91 taken as a degree vote or my origin from a not so famous university I was given something confidence that in our country has been scarce for some time meritocracy concrete autonomy possibility of getting involved and risk from part of a company that bets on someone have given me the opportunity to grow in a work environment where you are often solidarity between colleagues where you are a team to get a result explained to me I was left the spaces to act independently the environment is then young with an average age of 35 years and often this makes the difference above all in works that require new approaches in my short experience in Milan I was able to see how deep the intergenerational rigidity was that often translates into mental rigidity while abroad you are a resource and not An obstacle here at 30 years can already be directors you don't have to hope to become an influence r to carve out a location you can aspire to put on the family with your own strength by also buying a house without the help of parents read also to Sarajevo I created a job from nothing, young Italians do not listen to those who say that dreams are impossible Italy, however, remains a country where formation is good above all on theory and this allows you a lot of versatility with respect to the Anglo -Saxon formation which remains too specific on certain subjects or sectors, however, then clashes with a world of work perched on archaic systems there are works In the anti -money laundering that in Italy require ten years of experience while abroad are easier access and underlines here there is not much difference between public and private you don't have a guaranteed place as if I had to win a competition in Italy the contract then do it if go well Otherwise you remain at expiry they send you via Tancredi does not exclude a return in the future but not now our country is too far behind certain work and contractual dynamics there is a lot of talk of brains of return and yet I often hear that if you have not made a career in Italy you do not come Well seen, for example, there are international certifications that abroad can double your salary based on the position in Italy even know what they are I am sorry that there are friends in Italy victims of a precarious work system on my part instead I am happy to finally see my wings explain
 China has many job opportunities are invested many more resources than in Italy and is trying to attract qualified foreigners offering many positions Massimiliano Galluzzi is 34 years old and since 2015 lives and works in Shenzhen from 15 million inhabitants who connects Hong Kong to the rest of the Asian country would like to return one day but went away to do the job for which I had studied Italy I miss it very much after attending the scientific high school in Cremona Massimiliano enrolled in the Faculty of Physics at the University of Milan choosing as an experimental physical specialization For the three -year and physical path of the subject for the master's degree, the thesis continued its studies with a doctorate in nanotechnology by spending six months for research experiences in Leeds in the United Kingdom Massimiliano says he wanted to leave Italy simply to do the job for which He had studied a German professor Stav To build a new research laboratory in Shenzhen and was looking for a person with my curriculum after an interview I decided to be part of this adventure in 2015 Massimiliano leaves for China for two years covers the role of Postdoc in the University of Shenzhen for another 2 years is appointed professor assistant at the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Tehcnology Siat in the same Institute at the end of 2019 is promoted to associate professor and today he is building a research group that deals with microscopy and Nanomechanics read also in Australia C is a job flexibility here I can be Mistress of my time Shenzhen represents a unique environment explains Massimiliano as it is evolving at a very high rhythm in the field of new technologies and electronics thus attracting many people interested in the nanotechnology sector and increasing the can Iability of exchange development of ideas and collaborations regarding the research Massimiliano explains that in China many more resources are invested compared to Italy, university is very focused on the result and exerts great pressure on the staff to obtain research and publications at the same time Shenzhen It has more than 15 million inhabitants and the competition is fierce leading to have a work and study environment that is not always pleasant in general, salaries are higher the original professor of Cremona then adds that foreigners are kept with an eye because Universities are trying to grow and make themselves more international reads also in Sarajevo I created a job from nothing, young Italians do not listen to those who say that dreams are impossible in the university for Massimiliano there is no real daily routine it all depends on the organization of the work done weekly dividing the time into measures teaching and office for date analysis or study writing in general you work from 9 00 to 18 00 with an hour of lunch break but the times are quite flexible during a session of measures are often with younger collaborators to whom I teach research activities preparation samples measures and data analysis where even if it is not widespread here we are talking in English, Italy is missing and the relationship with their own country has always been good indeed before before Leaving the country Massimiliano says I had some local opportunities but in the end I chose to leave out of curiosity but also for a salary higher possibility of making an academic career in university and greater access to economic resources for scientific research due to distance e Due to the Covid restrictions for 2 years Massimiliano cannot To return to see family and friends at the moment has maintained a scientific collaboration with the research group of the University of Milan which thanks to a particular instrumentation for the preparation of surfaces helps him to prepare samples for tests and measures but I really think of returning to the plan I am stable by writing some financing for research and hoping to be successful I could have the opportunity to return by keeping a position similar to that obtained in China my wife who has lived many years in Germany would be happy to move to Italy or Europe the dream is to maintain A affiliation in China and Italy would be an excellent opportunity to encourage research smiles to be able to act as a bridge between Italian and Chinese culture would also reflect the desires of my family
When Federica visited her laboratory in Houston for the first time, the feeling of amazement remained speechless remained for a while among the cutting -edge machinery the conferences and the first experiments now this is my life and I feel very lucky Federica Giordano has 32 years old and comes from Palermo today is a researcher in the field of nanotechnolgie at the Houston Methodist Research Institute in the USA the same center where he had the opportunity to work for a year during the PhD in Molecular and Translational Medicine carried out at the University of Milan Bicocca are It was fascinated by the multiple nanotechnological applications and by the possibility of ranged in different lines of research the avant -garde technologies the possibility of collaborating with luminaries of the world of research and that of participating in great importance have prompted me to leave my beloved land remembers Federica al made it the first impact in Hou Ston was the enormous roads the lack of the city center in a purely European style everything was far away and not very connected by public transport the first week at work was a bit like returning to the first day among the school desks with a new language And a new culture to be absorbed in a very short time despite having always studied English talking it daily in all contexts is not the same thing the goal of Federica's research is to use nanoparticles as a vehicle for the transport of drugs for the treatment of tumors by combining The effectiveness of target therapy with that of the nanoparticles The day spends between laboratory experiments with cells reports Meeting articles at the moment I am following and managing a rather important project and other slightly smaller projects in which I support or supervision in our work there There are many deadlines to respect that for some strange Right usually overlap the impact of the pandemic on the research in the USA, a blow was unexpected that has affected student and academic researchers with most of the suspended or redirected works to deal with Covid 19 a blow that explains Federica will leave after the years a Coming Federica believes that Italian university education is excellent but is combined with a scenario that to say it with the words of a recent report published in Nature is characterized by uncertainty about the working conditions poor satisfaction and a precarious condition that unites researchers from all over the whole world in most cases adds the Palermo researcher, the salaries of a doctoral or research assignist in Italy correspond to the legal minute between 1 100 1 500 euros net per month while in the USA the salaries range from 1 900 to 3 000 euros net per month For the same positions a respectable figure if para Gonata to Italian salaries but which adds is not always sufficient to face the cost of living between health insurance and rent especially in the city such as New York or San Francisco the salary is also balanced on 40 hours per week but does not take into account the hours of extraordinary and of the Weekend spent in the laboratory a constant in this type of work to return home after a period abroad I think it is the question that sooner or later all those who left Italy smile Federica are sure if I could have the same economic and working opportunities that I have Here in the US I would return to Italy I know that there are facilitations for those who return but the questions and fears remain the same as when we left we can make a career we can be enhanced to build a future are not enough for the concessions on continuous taxes but we must resolve the Problem for which we go to a perspective for the Long -term future would be beautiful in short, if only there were opportunities and resources similar to those we have abroad to be able to return to teach and contribute to the progress of our country all the friends or acquaintances who went abroad before me they told me once you put foot outside From Italy you will no longer come back I still hope that he gets wrong Federica concludes because it is in Italy that I would like to create my family and my future
 I feared for the quality of life that I could have had in Italy here I found an angle of unexpected paradise conquered, however, not without commitment and sacrifice Roberta Vodola 32 years originally from Atella in the province of Potenza in 2014 started for Sydney where today he works as a dentist in Australia C is a work flexibility that I could hardly have had in our country today I am the master of my time after a degree in dentistry in Varese and the subsequent enabling examination Roberta decides to take a sabbatical year for better English I had a first experience in the Farm and then I came back with the idea of ??knowing the Australian dental environment and the wait to find a position in a private study is not so three days long I was looking for a job as an assistant by omitting my qualification both because I had to start the recognition procedure and for the linguistic rock I used to the ear during the Time confesses to the fact it despite not having any experience immediately receives a salary that allows you to be autonomous from there I started thinking about the validation of the title I still did not know that I would have to face a bureaucracy that has nothing to envy to the Italian laws Even astronoma in Australia here life is beautiful and I have a prestigious assignment I have never regretted having started health specializations have an eye to abroad but the path of recognition of credits is a pity if you think that fields like that engineering are much more facilitated in this sense states Roberta takes a year just to present the documentation above all the validation of credits has needed a long process, the Australian academic world is used to having close contacts with the Asian one and little with The European one at least for small universities C is less confidence then you have to pass an exam consisting of two written tests and practice you can only register every six months and the places are limited and to overcome it I had to do it twice by cutting the working hours to study A path not without even cheap sacrifices in everything I put three years and over 25 thousand dollars I am proud to have made this investment with my earnings here without having to ask for help in Roberta C's words is the redemption of those who have not sold to Difficulty pursuing his goal day after day I didn't want to stay in Varese even nearby Milan as much as a dynamic city was a little attractiveness I already imagined I imagined in traffic for hours tight in a working environment not very flexible in the Sydney neighborhood where he lives a few minutes From Center C it is the green c is the sea here not all work full time c is very much Flexibility is not the culture of six weekly working days if you need to take holidays you can plan them when you want to change jobs must not necessarily become a jump in the dark I know that I can choose whether to range in other fields of my field no one will label you for what you did so far 1 6 Australia 1 Read also veterinary in France in Italy unworthy proposals I had to say thank you to work for free who goes away like me is forced to do it the pandemic blocked at home for a few weeks in Australia did not really feel a few months ago and unfortunately the population He started vaccinating late than other continents perhaps because he felt safe once the boundaries are closed during the first wave in Europe The new South Wales is the state of the continent most affected by the Delta variant we are experimenting with the first real Lockdown but not I feel the weight I can move between the clinics He for which I work and do open -open sports certainly cannot receive guests at home and our movements are limited but the vaccination campaign is taking hold and I am confident in a similar period a thought always goes to the family are very close to them I hope to be able to see them Soon live but I don't see in my future a return to Italy never say never certainly I would prefer that they come here for a holiday when it will be possible I will always thank them for the trust they granted me when I started this adventure here I have opportunities that in Italy I could hardly have obtained
When he left in October 2015 by plane for Brussels Valeria he thought that a new phase of his life was opening up I said goodbye to my city perhaps forever and all Italy today Valeria Imperato 31 years originally from Bari lives and works in Belgium in Gent He deals with microbiology I would never have gone away but I did it to make myself professionally three years in biotechnology at the University of Bari Master in industrial biotechnology at the University of Milan Bicocca PhD in biology at the University of Hasselt Belgium Valeria has focused on the study of Plants and bacteria to purify environments polluted by hydrocarbons unlike many expats the first impact with my nation d adoption was not so strong I had already been for Erasmus Traineeship and I had carried out part of the thesis in a foreign research laboratory recommended highly recommended experience I do not doubt that the Belgian research system has been affected Or from the pandemic crisis he explains to the fact it Valeria but overall adds he rectum how he could only happen in a nation that really and seriously invests in science today the Apulian researcher works as an Expert microbiologist at Aphea Bio a spin off of the Flemish Institute for Biotechnology which has the aim of putting new generation biopesticidal and biofertilizers for sustainable agriculture, my role consists in optimizing the microorganisms considered as the most promising to make them act even better in the field in practice so many new new experiments to plan and carry out But also so many satisfactions The working day is rich moments of study of scientific literature planning new experiments reworking of results in meetings with other colleagues tutoring of students experimental activities in the laboratory you never get bored smiles Valeria loves her job because she has Much freedom and the organization of the days often depends on her here there is a great respect for workers of all ages as a young researcher Valeria says she was able to trace my way independently working hard but not having to pray anyone you can pursue a career scientific being economically independent at the moment these factors are often lacking in Italy for young scientists the cost of living on average in Belgium is the highest 12 compared to Italy explains Valeria but wages are also higher and given my experience adds more dignified Another important aspect is the contractual clarity no subterfuge my classification respects my training my experience and I am referring to both my years in the public and to this first work experience in a private company that I have been living since December without forgetting the appearance Belgium taxes adds Valeria is one of the states More taxed in Europe, the taxes if paid by everyone and managed appropriately only do nothing but go back in terms of services I do an example I was a few months old in the past I did not ask my parents for a euro and I didn't even touch the my savings since I perceived about the 80 of my previous salary more the placement office supported me monthly by offering me courses and work possibilities explains to do research for Valeria means curiosity enthusiasm passion but also team work patience has ever thought how it would be like that Life if it hadn't started no it is a decision that I firmly made for my professional ambitions if I went back I would make the same choice my life is here and now what is expected of the future Valeria my dreams walk with me never too far away smiles are we are working on the products that will be released on the market but I would like to coordinate U one day no of our departments and who knows how to become technical director in Italy maybe yes but only to do the job for which I trained with the right contractual framework and relative salary
The main differences between Italy and Denmark honestly the money available for those like me who makes research and the recruitment processes that are certainly more transparent mariaceleste Aragona is 35 years old and is originally from Porcia in the province of Pordenone in 2014 it started for Brussels with a post DOC All Ulb University Libre de Brussels since 2020 has been a associate professor and Group leader at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark I basically think I still have the hope of returning one day but I know that this probability is extremely low specialist degree in medical biotechnology for Marceleste the years Training in Padua were fundamental I learned a method of scientific rigor and to work hard reminds the fact when it arrives in Brussels for the first time you immediately feel at home here I had the opportunity to open my horizons of being multidisciplinary tells and thanks to scholarships won to pursue projects of Search in a completely independent way mariaceleste explains that at the beginning the Lockdown was a shock but in Belgium the research is considered essential work in a short time so it managed to obtain official permits to be able to move and reach the laboratory when the Pandemia Mariaceleste broke out was On the way while his latest post -DOG All Ulb work was planning visits and job interviews in different European universities, some were canceled luckily I had already received two offers from London and one from Copenhagen I chose the second today Mariaceleste directs a group Research at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology in Copenhagen specialized in research on epithelial stem cells to develop new reconstructive medicine therapies, I was offered a laboratory space already equipped in a research center with the avant -garde services and tools I can Use a Gruz for free Important zolo of funds intended for the recruitment of qualified personnel and support in the management of requests for further state and European funding explains the alarm clock sounds at 6 30 arrives every day by bike I got used to any weather condition and when you can enjoy the Danish sea I live a few minutes from the beach but nothing in common with the Mediterranean if today Marceleste is a associate professor and group leader in a Danish university merit is also of the Italian University explains in Italy the formation is of the highest level I owe everything to the past years at the University of Padua Where I built the solid foundations of my next path and I am not an exception, think of the stories of many Italian emigrants in your address book, just see the research centers from all over the world full of Italian girls and boys who work hard and abroad receive compensation adequate for their training for Marceleste is not the yes Italian university system to have to change the problem are the money intended for research a salary from Post DOC in Belgium is certainly more advantageous than the Italian one continues and a salary as a associate professor in Denmark is even higher the big difference are precisely the funds intended for the Research in Italy are very few centers that can offer a start -up Grant to young people to start new research lines thinks of returning one day Mariaceleste has difficulty answering this question I made several talks in various research centers and European universities in which you In addition to your salary, a solid initial financing package that allows a young man to build the group and the laboratory based on their ideas unfortunately in Italy these positions are few and few are also offered, and a space is hardly offered. to the single find the funds and continue in Itali The funding for research are few public funds are scarce and private ones are not comparable to the sums overseas often in Italy to do research is not considered a real job that the production of knowledge is misunderstood is not seen as a development opportunity As happens from direct experience in Belgium and Denmark Marceleste admires very much friends and colleagues who managed to return through a thousand difficulties probably I conclude I chose the most comfortable way
 In Italy after the doctorate, a young researcher cannot access research funds and can only start precarious contracts Grazia Accardo 39 years of Campania origins has gone away in 2015 direction South Korea today lives and works in the Basque Country where he deals with research on I would like to return battery materials for batteries but it is almost impossible grace graduated in industrial chemistry in Naples and has always worked at the university after the doctorate flew to Seoul thanks to a grant research check of 5 years the first impact is Traumatic was an immersion in an environment and a culture where everything was extremely different, food seemed strange and immaid it was very difficult to communicate light signs insignia indications was discouraging to the fact it when he visited the research center in which he would have worked grace was Struck by its size buildings with workshops offices shops in the sleep restaurants Bulls and apartments for researchers and students Football fields Tennis Gyms the first thing they told me to do was to open the account in the bank within the institute for me was incredible I had not yet started the job and they worried about my salary smiles Read Read Also from my Telegram channel created when I studied at the University I managed to found a company in Dubai the pandemic in South Korea did not particularly affect research activities explains few closures or limitations thanks to an efficient prevention system and the monitoring of cases I have Always worked in the presence in complete safety and sporadically in Smart Working the salary of grace in Korea was comparable to that of an Italian associate professor but with a much lower taxation making the tax return every year was not only or BBiglitorio but also convenient because often refunds refunds of structural relief deductions more the cashback system has been a reality for years it has been working very well, stimulates internal consumption and returns something to consumers, however adding the cost of living especially to Seoul was very high and some essential services As healthcare were private covered by a compulsory basic health insurance deducted from the salary every month, read even a workplace, young Italians do not listen to those who say that dreams are impossible after 5 years grace, I decided to decide Accepting a position in Europe during the pandemic moved to a small town in the Basque Country in Spain since I had a girl who was born in Seul my life is very quiet and my husband and both researchers and the newspaper ATA is dedicated to our work and to our daughter explains Grazia has a very conflictual relationship with her country of origin I miss in a visceral way certainly but other times I feel a deep regret especially when I think about politics and opportunities it does not offer young people despite the Numerous criticisms to which the Italian university system is subjected can say with conviction that the Italian training is of the highest level continuously during my career I had the opportunity to follow and interface with foreign students and researchers, their preparation was more oriented to technological application but too sectoralized and in front of a problem that diverged from their experience they were unable to find a solution in Italy by grace, the infrastructures that are not very beyond dated and obsolete avant -garde with a certain financial programming to support keep maintain and to maintain e ffficienti or expand the small and large equipment for research activities read also in Barcelona because I dream of doing the interpreter in Italy exhausting works in Spain C is respect for rest the largest dream of grace is to win a European project as a principal investigator having A research group of it all of her abroad for research reasons to pass a few years out to see other realities is not for me a negative aspect but a fundamental and almost obligatory stop in the training path and in the career of a researcher the real problem is precisely the return On a stable basis adds the channels dedicated to the return are insufficient to difficult access do not offer enough places and concludes I had the opportunity to work in one of the best research centers of all of Asia in a country like South Korea that invests on 10 11 de your GDP in Basque Country I had the trust to measure myself in a completely different research field all this has enriched me I don't think that remaining in Italy I would have had the same opportunities
 If I could go back the maturity I would enroll in an American or English university, it is not only lessons and courses but a stimulating environment new prospects new friendships and above all new challenges when it was at the university in Rome in 2014 Gianluca had created a Telegram channel where there were companions colleagues relatives the item was added other people I made myself paid a very small subscription given budget analysis of large companies listed operational ideas The interest c was then but now the community has grown and has become my profession today He lives and works in Dubai where he opened his company Gianluca Sidoti 30 years originally from Ascoli says he has always had great passion for the economy and finance since he was in the classical high school unlike many of my colleagues, however, I considered training essential academic a degree in economics a master's degree in technical analysis one in International Business and one in Finance has left a job in Malta to devote himself to his company with the arrival of the pandemic and the lockdown online activities grew dramatically and I had to resume control of the Gianluca company so in October 2020 he moved to Dubai Following the advice of some customers who had lived in the Emirates for some time and there he decides to continue living laws also in Tunisia and my wife and I have become entrepreneurs the Italy that I love fitted in a bureaucracy without vision today is CEO and founder of an international society that Helps entrepreneurs manager and freelancers such as accountants and doctors to protect and increase their capital in the Emirates The salaries of professionals are clearly higher than those of the Italians work work says Gianluca is not a bureaucraz ia and it is relatively easy both to find work there is a lot of offer and to constitute its own company, the western westerners add are welcome well seen and well paid to dubai but all private health education welfare the state gives you nothing is free to organize itself as you think continuous Gianluca is keen to clarify that in Dubai life is not like the one described on Instagram by the influencers who dart in Ferrari and live in the 5 -star Dubai hotel is a normal city explains and the cost of living is related to the quality of the services you have a Professional graduated in Dubai earns on average the Italian salary three times but the cost of living excluding parties in yacht luxury hotels and starry restaurants is comparable to that of a big city like Milan certainly not everything is gold what glitters as much as I live well in the Emirates must be remembered that we are talking about a country culturally very different from us co Ninua where only one family has governed by Generations Gianluca cannot say that I don't feel free I know that I am an immigrant the 92 of the population residing in the Emiians is immigrant and to be lucky to be able to live in a safe country that I think is my task Adapting to the laws and customs once you learn the behaviors to keep life is simple and you have no problems but if you make mistakes in the Emirates you pay a fine and often even prison adds laws in Italy there are no foreign talents and in the south the situation is really critical here a Barcelona are happy, Italians like all western westerners in the Emirates are seen and treated very well especially those who can produce wealth thanks to their specific skills the advice that you feel to give Italian boys is to expand the horizons the best and most updated horizons Academic paths today are not in Italy continuous for Gianluca in Italy there is no long -term vision that gives hope to the new generations in the Emirates last year a detailed development plan was published called Dubai 2050 they know where they want to go and each project is functional To the vision of what the Emirates will be in 30 years regrets nobody when I started I had 0 customers an srl of only costs and fixed contributions in Italy costs thousands of euros per month to not mention the bureaucracy acts to resolve because it is asked I would not like to pass the Message that we cannot do business concludes Gianluca when the turnover increases you must decide whether to stay in Italy and pay taxes with the money you earn or seek a more favorable jurisdiction I chose the second but I have a profound respect for those who choose to stay If I had stayed in Rome most likely today I would have had to be acconed ntare I wanted to internationalize myself but I understand that it is not the goal of everyone
 In Bosnia I found my professional path is a country that I love that formed my world view where I created a job as a job as Claudia Zini is 36 years old and is originally from Trento after the studies the doctorate in London and the I work in galleries and foundations including the Venice Biennale decided to move to Sarajevo where in 2018 he founded Kuma International Research Center dedicated to the visual arts of countries affected by wars and violence of which he is a director I remember very well the houses destroyed on the border With Croatia the hills of Sarajevo from where the attackers shot during the war so close to the city tells the fact it a feeling of restlessness mixed with great interest for a country so close to Italy Degree in contemporary art at the Ca Foscari University PhD by the Courtound Institute of Art of London Claudia did not see the time to leave not because I wanted to leave Italy but to learn the language Having experience abroad at the time, the Italian University was at a good level yes but the practical part was completely missing in my sector, read astronoma in Australia here life is beautiful and I have a prestigious assignment I never regretted having started in Sarajevo Today Claudia directs her research center over the years we have worked with about fifty artists photographers architects journalists and anthropologists photojournalists by welcoming students from about fifteen countries other than Europe to the United States and Australia with pandemic the work has moved mainly Online in Sarajevo C was a lockdown but we were free to leave the house to walk the impact here was not very strong tells in the first six months of 2020 but several programmed events were deleted we reorganized Ati combining events in presence with those on online platforms that had an unexpected success, the pandemic forced me to rethink our educational methods and was of great stimulus to find innovative solutions in Bosnia I created from nothing a place of work continuously Claudia One of the main differences has been complicated but it is in the average salary much lower but the cost of life is also the precise life for Claudia to be Italian abroad almost always means enjoying a profound respect and a little envy I have always been accepted in Very positive way to abroad love Italians even if they make fun of us for the mafia, corruption our attachment to the family and food smiles, read also engineer in Belgium in Italy have not offered me a contract for my height of my skills to return will have V must Angne the penalty wake up soon meeting office The day is not so different from what could be in Italy the changing thing is the language sometimes I miss talking Italian in difficult moments I think that working in my mother tongue would be easier yet to live and Working abroad in a reality that does not belong to you completely where you often feel foreign is very stimulating as well as extremely stressful sometimes continuous but it is a priceless experience that I am very grateful Claudia is not willing to abandon her projects to Sarajevo I would return to Italy if my family needed me explains dream of integrating the Bosnian reality of my organization with the Italian territory in order to build bridges and be able to spend more and more time in Italy I would start from Venice obviously Venice is home I lived there for many years I still have friends and a very deep bond with the city to work for The Biennale as curator of the Bosnia Herzegovina pavilion in 2019 was a huge privilege in 10 years still imagines herself in Sarajevo to work with Kuma International with international collaborations and perhaps the status of university master's degree recognized for its organization on one thing, however Claudia there He keeps his belief that Italians want to test themselves to face new challenges for this reason they move abroad also to improve their working conditions and continuously we all have nostalgia for Italy of a good cappuccino in the morning a real pizza la la Sunday evening but at the same time we are grateful to live abroad where every day is a challenge I would like to tell young Italians concludes that they never listen to those who say that our dreams are impossible or too ambitious is difficult and it is very afraid but the satisfactions when they arrive Photos of Enrico Dagnino and Yulia Kopr are priceless
 I arrived in Rome in 2012 after eight years in London I know workshops where it becomes complicated sometimes even to make a simple order for the substances of the experiments here in a few speak English The funding is scarce but the level is high and the Italy is now my home His name is Paraskevi Kraschia is 39 years old at the Campus Bio Medico University of Rome and is originally from Cyprus in Italy he won a scholarship to finance his research to slow down the development of Alzheimer's disease also read astronoma in Australia here life is life Beautiful and I have a prestigious assignment I never regretted having left Paraskevi was born and raised in Cyprus moved to Greece when she was 18 to graduate in biology after graduation flies to London for a master's degree in neuroscience at UCL where it remains for Seven years then completing a postdoc in Cambridg And my competence is the electrophysiology use of small electrodes to study the currents that pass through the neuronal cells tells in 2012 I became part of the laboratory of Professor Mercuri at the Santa Lucia Foundation in Rome this experience was important to understand the consequences Of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, my main research interest now in the laboratory of Professor Marcello D Amelio at the Campus Bio Medico University of Rome Paraskevi is one of the 7 researchers who have won the Agra 2020 Airalzh Gras for Young Researchers with ambitious projects which aim at the study of the early stages of the development of the Alzheimer Airalz onlus disease is the association that promotes medical scientific research on this disease at national level and other forms of dementia specifically paraskever is studying the hippocampus with the aim of trying to slow down the Alzheim's disease Er diagnosed the disease in advance with a non -invasive technique for patients, the first results will arrive December 2021 The publication of the research conducted by paraskevi is scheduled in two years read in Italy there are no foreign talents and in the south the situation is really critical here in Barcelona are Felice London was a cosmopolitan city today in my laboratory I am the only non -Italian but I am in love with Italy and the frankness of the Romans everything else, however, the bureaucracy and time needed to open a current account was a little more complicated to find a doctor of base obtaining a tax code things that in London are made in a few hours they took weeks and many movements tell at the beginning I walked a lot not understanding how to read the buses maps at the stops until I took a car from the point of Vist A professional do research in Italy has nothing to envy to research abroad when it comes to quality dedication or ideas explains Paraskevi is no coincidence that many of the Italian universities are among the best in Europe and I speak from personal experience when I also say that Much of the professors are well trained in their subjects and in their field and this reflects the abilities of Italians abroad that excel in various areas in Italy for paraskeexes, however, it is more difficult to do research due to the lack of funds for the opportunities for young researchers And the lenses of career advancements, read also I left France and Luxembourg to return and launch my company the slowness of Italy can be an advantage at the beginning of 2020, the pandemic has slowed down everything the meetings have stopped the planning of experiments between colleagues has become more complicated the interaction between people who is an essential part for research the resolution of problems and the exchange of ideas has become much more difficult fortunately we managed to adapt quickly to the new models during the pandemic and now the online meetings Most of the people I know have become everyday life continued to work despite the restrictions the self -certifications and the various regulations you must know that it is not easy to prevent a researcher from working when there are experiments to be smiled to make a paraskeys to do research has always been the way to respond to the many curiosities since I was a child and I don't think this feeling will ever go away is my way out I cannot think of not doing this job for now his days are divided between research and teaching assistance his I dream one day is to have a laboratory of his own return to Cyprus c On my partner we have thought about it many times but we always come to the conclusion that we will go as a retirees perhaps in a house near the sea of ??sure there is always the nostalgia of their country of origin the family and friends are missing the house but here in Italy I have Built a new life a second family and a career now I conclude I feel at home
When he moved to Australia in 2013 Barbara already had important experiences behind the United States and in Germany, it was certainly not my first move smiles today after 20 years spent outside Italy he directs a group of researchers in the field of extragalactic astronomy All International Center for Radio Astronomy Research in Perth for a radio stove like me Australia and South Africa were the most promising options tells here the life is beautiful but I do not exclude to return when I will be close to the Pension Diploma of Scientific High School Degree in Physics at the Milan state road In 1997 Barbara Catinella left Italy in 1998 to start a PhD in astronomy at Cornell University Ithaca NY then the experiences in Arecibo Puerto Rico at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching in Germany and Melbourne at the Swinburne University of Technology here thanks to one prestigious fellowship I started in building Using my small research group tells in 2015 he obtained an indefinite contract at the International Center for Radio Astronomy Research University of Western Australia in Perth where my parents still works have always encouraged me to follow my way I have never regretted myself To have started smiles, I also read engineer in Belgium in Italy have not offered me a contract for my skills to return will have to be worth it Barbara today directs a team of eight people I deal with the study of galaxies as they are formed and evolve that ownership have and What physical processes influence stellar evolution explains my specialty is the study of hydrogen the material from which the stars are formed that is measured with the radioteleschopes due to the pandemic has been deleted the meeting of the Astronomical Community In Rnational to whom Barbara had been working for three years but Australia has been lucky and the impact of the epidemic was less strong that in other countries being so isolated from the rest of the world and having only 25 million inhabitants concentrated in a few cities adds in the field of research in Astronomy The main problems caused by the pandemic were the total blocking of even national travels, the closure of telescopes and distance teaching due to extensive periods of Lockdown Barbara still feels very close to Italy in 2020 has obtained Australian citizenship not only to have full Freedom to travel and move internationally I like Australia from many points of view I wanted to feel more integrated and for example being able to vote on the salary is higher than in Italy explains but also the cost of living increases if we talk about food for rent and insurance health must have a private one in addition to that national one Ale Read also in Tunisia, my wife and I have become entrepreneurs, Italy that I love fitted in a bureaucracy without vision having worked in the USA Germany and Australia Barbara has always been impressed by the high level of Italian university education there are many Italians explain that they built themselves Successful careers abroad and largely due to the studies that have done in their country of origin in the last decade then the quality of university education all over the world seems to gradually worsen Barbara notes one of the main stimuli that has pushed it to emigrate After graduation, the difference in working conditions was astronomers in Italy seemed more complicated the salaries were significantly lower and the funds for scarce or non -existent research, however, it seems that they are gradually c Having crossed now I have not been working in Italy for more than 20 years so it is difficult for me to comment in detail but I have a good number of friends and colleagues who have decided to return to Italy and have managed to find places in universities or research institutes this suggests that in the Last years we have seen an active effort in slowing down the flight of the brains a positive signal continues to do research for Barbara means having to face new problems and getting to find solutions to find solutions, research is never the same and it is always stimulating her dream is to see the squire kilometer Authority the international project conceived in 1991 which aims to build the largest network of radio and telescopes in the world in Australia and South Africa in the meantime Barbara has bought home in Perth where the quality of life is excellent I am in a hurry to leave once in Pension would not be sorry to return to Italy to be closer to the family to the benefit ni would recommend having an experience abroad even for a couple of years I had the opportunity to travel to go to conferences to observe with some of the best telescopes in the world, research in astronomy is now globalized and it is important to expand your horizons as soon as if has the possibility
In Tunisia, the manager is the manager in the safety sector and also the actor improvisation in my work is fundamental and helps me in daily professional relationships Andrea Barilli has 41 and is originally from viadana in the province of Mantua for four years lives in the North African country and left L Italy brought with him work and passion also in the Belpaese he dealt with security systems and recited musicals in the context of a cultural association to know the body language tells Andrea is useful to understand the people who are in front of you his wife Stephanie 35 year old Italian French L He met in Bologna where he had gone to live for study reasons by making theater ten years on stage and many shows in the city of medieval towers also read the court of graduate accounts fleeing from Italy +41 8 from 2013 higher level of education does not help to find work Then the Tunisia that represents a family project by Andrea Di Stephanie and little Sophie my wife and he tells him we shared the choice to move from employees to entrepreneurs, albeit following different objectives Andrea specialized in cybersecurity the creative wife of the company The parental break a Project to which multiple figures of communicators Obstetric Nurses Expert in breastfeeding collaborate in order to support the pregnant couples by enhancing the relationship of parents children, we take care of supporting future parents says it through pre and post -birth courses on the best way to communicate with children A project that in addition to filling a deficiency of offer stimulates a question that is not fully expressed, Andrea's company that operates in the field of security has no employees but establishes relationships with a network of professionals in the Tunisian and Italian sector by offering services in EUR Opa Africa and in the French -speaking countries the most important reason for the departure from Italy the manager's manager summarizes it so with an apparent contradiction we had everything but something was missing is just so nice work excellent colleagues the Bolognese environment we liked but both for us and especially for our daughter We wanted a more multicultural environment for our little living here in a crossroads of different languages ??and cultures of the English Arabian Araba Ivorian Asian Arabic English would have been an opportunity not to be missed and in fact Sophie today speaks four languages ??in a multicultural environment such as Tunisia Andrea and Stephanie They see more opportunities for growth and not only cheap than in Italy the country where I was born that I love very much excels in many sectors but finds itself stuck in bureaucratic mechanisms without a global vision on the future read too Engineer in Belgium in Italy did not offer me a contract for my skills to return will have to be worth it then there is the issue of the cost of living in Tunisia tendentially low for some food genres from 1 3 to 1 compared to Italy the rent of A villa with garden in a beautiful area tells Andrea is equivalent to that of a 90 square meter apartment on the outskirts of an Italian city on the salary front instead for manual works, the Tunisians are paid 200 250 euros per month and can live work without problems It is not a value, absenteeism is normal in these categories in medium companies an employee reaches 300 400 euros perhaps also 500 but the economic leap is done by actually international realities so the gain doubles in some cases triples if then managerial roles are covered The salaries are higher than the Italian ones of the same working position a super This is how Andrea defines it is to be able to adapt to a more respectful rhythm than the less frenetic time the low cost of life allows you to better manage working time and dedicate more to the family you can also have better training opportunities and you can remove whims that in Italy they would have a prohibitive cost how to send children to a private international school and attend 5 -star hotels that cost like a 3 star on the Riviera in Italy and still the pensioners who live here while receiving a thousand euros per month have a living tenor that in Italy they could only have with triple pension would like to return to Italy Andrea but at the same time he could not do without the advantages that Tunisia offered him thinks that the last of the year we went to friends and on the table C They were passports of 13 different nations on the cases of Covid in the country Andrea gives this reading we were lucky l year sc Orso the closures of the borders have been anticipated, however, perhaps he exaggerated himself by putting the economy in crisis but today thanks to those choices, the situation is under control Andrea does not feel a brain on the run but certainly try to curb the young Tunisians to leave to other countries Francophones Canada France Belgium and the Gulf Qatar Emirates I would like to

The first time he arrived in Brazil was 1998 in Italy he said for him there were few perspectives started with Italian lessons in San Paolo Citt from over 12 million inhabitants within a few months I had the agenda full of contacts today reminds 20 years later with a Master a scholarship and a competition won Paolo Ricci 47 years from Ravenna is a teacher of political science at the University of San Paolo The boys must internationalize explains the expatriation is no longer a definitive choice after graduating in 1997 in Science Policies at the University of Bologna Paolo decides to leave for Brazil passed the first impact the road is downhill in 2000 a master's degree begins in 2008 wins a competition and becomes professor assistant here the reception is at home is the norm many Brazilians feel Italian thanks thanks The millions of compatriots emigrated until 1920 in the So Paulo region is estimated that 15 of the Brazil population Ana has Italian ancestors in the city say that there are about 5 thousand pizzerias smiles, read also engineer in Belgium in Italy have not offered me a contract for my skills to return will have to be worth it the country's financial center and one of the most populous cities in the world San Paolo is a metropolis where movements can also last a couple of hours the major difficulties explain are financial linked to a very high cost of living this is a dear city especially if you don't have a owned house if you have children then and Paolo has two of 9 and 19 years of age has to pay straight lines from 200 300 euros per month to afford a good school since the public one does not have a good reputation itself speech if we talk about health care, public health continues Paolo is at a very low level who can allow him to pay an insurance that For three people it is around 400 500 euros per month and Brazil in recent weeks has experienced a very strong pandemic wave worsened precisely because of a public health network particularly lacking also from the point of view of health material and medicines on the population the effects They are devastating and have aggravated poverty tells Paul L inability of the Federal Government to provide an adequate response is enormous at the local level even if we talk about Lockdown continuously has never applied it to 100 I have the clear feeling that we will not see big improvements within the End of the year at the Department of Political Sciences where there are many American students and professors, there are strong incentives for research and collaboration with the United States, this is very close, this translates in less frontal lessons a couple of week to the maximum while the rest of the time is managed between research activities In large part financed by the government of the state of So Paulo I have no doubt are a privileged compared to many other Brazilians or self -employed workers in the sector and the differences are also evident on the salary front on average the Brazilian citizen gains a misery around 1 600 Reais Less than 300 euros in Saint Paul generally the wages are higher often the Italians complain to me to laugh when I think of the Brazilian reality, read even we have returned to Italy from Finland but we will start here you must always be drained work often fired there is the option to return In Italy as a pensioner I certainly smile Paolo would not leave the Brazilian university to do something different in Italy the stimuli I have here are enormous between subsidies for research and special funds it would be nice to return to enter the Italian university world Certainly but it does not seem to me to be an option, it adds indeed even if the effort is appropriate and right the return policy should also be rethought with incentives for children and tax breaks removed this C is all the discussion on the bureaucracy that more than incentivize produces contrary effects For Paolo, the populist and sovereignty wave of recent years has created a gap between the western world and the Brazilians strengthening his prejudices his future for now remains in San Paolo together with his wife his daughters and the assignment to the university here compared to Italy there are the conditions for investing in various fields despite the current health crisis, the economy is stimulating and the opportunities are not lacking

 In my life I lived more abroad that in Italy passing from Germany the United States France Spain certainly there is no shortage of problems here but there are also abroad and many also in the workplace Giovanni Landi is 52 years old and is originally from Bologna in Bologna Philosophy even if he has always worked in companies and multinationals in the hi tech and renewable energies sector since 2021 has returned to Italy together with his wife and son and is happy with the choice the idea that abroad everything is always better Giovanni attended medium and superior to France where he moved as a child when he decided to return to enroll in the University in Milan at the Faculty of Philosophy for a month, my parents did Maretta smiles as soon as he graduated found work in France which was followed by one series of experiences between Grenoble Madrid Palo Alto Monaco of Bavaria up to the return to Milan for Giovanni the I Tiliani at abroad have always distinguished themselves thanks also to the mental flexibility that allows us to manage heterogeneous environments with a listening capacity higher than the Germans or even the French certainly the Italy is not a paradise between the heaviness of the bureaucracy and the difficulties of citizens in doing worth your rights read also we are back in Italy from Finland but we will start here you must always be drained work often foiled what is striking, thinking about it now is that at each return I saw the country improved and I have always found it difficult to understand the Italians who complained thinking that all foreign everything was always better when I was very young I continue Giovanni I also thought so but over time the age and perhaps even experience I learned to appreciate many things in Italy who do not always appear or are considered in Statistics on the quality of life Giovanni speaks five languages ??and has held increasingly high -level managerial roles in companies for which he worked a typical day in Germany, for example, we started around 9 and 6 pm the colleagues had already been the relationship with the Head is rare if there are no particular problems while spending much more time to make reports of various kinds with a level of bureaucracy that has nothing to envy to a ministry if we talk about quality of life in Munich Giovanni uses the monotonous words boring to describe his latest experience he had few contacts with the clubs and when you are no longer there twenty years and the disco release is no longer the maximum aspiration for Saturday evening not even Berlin is then so fascinating in Italy you can also be tourists. Weekend in Monaco you can take trips out of town but the countryside around is desolately the same in all directions the first Sometimes it is beautiful and disappeared then we tire the differences also apply to salaries there are countries where you earn more but there are also where you earn less in Monaco the salaries are on average higher but the cost of living is the same As happens in London, the same goes for the taxation system, it is not true that in Italy taxes are higher ever that in other countries Germany has a taxation between Irpef and higher contributions than Italy and the national health service is not at the same Level without private insurance, waiting times are longer and doctors and hospitals are not better than our laws also family doctor in Denmark I was tired of doing the nights and uncertainty here my family has a peaceful future because returning to Italy not I wanted my son born in Munich to become German 100 Giovanni explains and then Germany has a very particular and competitive school system where at 9 years your destiny is already decided the Italian school is much more enriching in my opinion in recent years the level of service of the public administration in Italy has grown a lot of continuous John including the use of new technologies and some of these things I mean smiles to help his young people Italy should improve and enhance its school system by increasing the effort for the teaching of English which is now frank language in Europe if it were to give A advice to young John would say to learn not only English but also another European language and then travel to try to think of European citizens immediately without being influenced by those who continue to repeat that abroad is everything better and better Italy concludes is A great country as are the other countries that surround us

 After ten years of nights as a doctor on guard and few possibilities to grow professionally I decided to try to give my family that serene future that Italy does not seem to be able to guarantee Margherita GiulioDori born in 1974 doctor specialized in infectious diseases with a specialist training in medicine General today is a family doctor in ESBJERG Denmark where she moved to 2016 together with her husband Giacomo Information Engineer and their three children read also veterinary in France in Italy unworthy proposals I had to say thank you to work for free who goes away like me is forced to do it Originally from Osimo in the Marche region to which we are very close Margherita faced a difficult choice like that of having to grow their children out of their country I was tired of making the nights tired of having to wait for an assignment As a family doctor who did not know when and if he would arrive he tells my husband had ceased his business and he could not find work because in Italy it is difficult for an engineer while here he found the work of his dreams in a short time the idea was That of remaining inside the European borders also evaluated England Ireland and Sweden then in 2015 I participated in a recruiting meeting at the Polytechnic of Ancona for an agency that was looking for medical staff for Denmark and we understood that it could be the place Just from the interviews via Skype and in the presence you could already understand the difference in step my husband participated in both because whoever was giving us this opportunity wanted to understand if there was the possibility of transferring the whole family the linguistic rock was certainly not a walk but The program guaranteed from the first month both for her and for her husband a salary just to study the Danish We spent the first ten months to learn the language and I was paid like a doctor underlines Margherita the health is free in Denmark but the figure of the family doctor has substantial differences compared to Italy here are in all respects a freelancer affirms Margherita we have a 30 of patients guaranteed by the Region and the rest are refunds to performance I do not have the obligation of availability as in Italy I work eight hours a day five days out of seven and at 16 detachment because here you leave a lot of time to devote the serenity to the family Family is almost a dogma Denmark has been rewarded by the OECD as the best country in the world where to grow a family and the second pillar focused on the educational aspect, children are stimulated since kindergarten to feel part of the community and active members of the company for example at school It is the students who clean and take care of the common spaces is not someone else to OP Hearing efficient services that have a price The cost of living is almost double the Italian one confirms Margherita, however it is widely compensated by the income that are almost three times those of our country in Italy with three young children we arrived with difficulty at the end of the month even with My salary as a doctor while here in a few years we bought home read hairdresser in Switzerland here invest in me in Italy I felt a weight to be impossible to find the same conditions also from the health point of view things are different here is not expected to be the The figure of the pediatrician are the family doctors who must perform this function as well as the non -specialist gynecological visits a part of the day is then dedicated to emergencies and are the family doctors who decide serious cases separately if a patient must or should not and and are in the emergency room with a consequent lightening of the hospital system during the start of the Covid emergency, Denmark as well as a first one month Lockdown where everything has been done to quickly reopen schools unlike Italy has invested a lot in tracking with a capillary Campaign in which the response of the swabs was given in 2 3 days recalls the vaccination campaign instead also here there were slowdowns with the 6 7 of the population vaccinated with two doses and the 12 with one the Scandinavian country was the first to suspend As a precaution, the Astrazeneca vaccine extending the stop until April 18th of us family doctors, we have vaccinated the elderly in the RSA and indicated the fragile patients to be included in the lists for the rest are the vaccination centers that deal with all the link with our country Even after years it remains firm we are growing our children as bilingual we always come back as Do we can in our Osimo and we must thank Italy for the university theoretical formation that has been highly appreciated here, however, Margherita says, however, the negative sides must also be highlighted and among these in my field two on all little practical experience for medical students and too long Dedicated to bureaucracy and not only from direct experience are in contact with my Italian colleagues and many of them are constantly invaded by the paper while here we do everything electronically and patients really come to be treated or for a diagnosis also states the trainees have from Immediately a salary as a doctor that allows him to create a family before the thirty years when they do not succeed even after changing the country, he certainly genres a great stress especially when he is not alone for Margherita having found a professional gratification and a more serene expectation For the future of our children he has moved away The possibility of

 Four exams from the degree arrived the first job proposal in Paris a contract that in Italy I would have dreamed of no I didn't think twice to take flight and this time one way Maurizio La Cava is 34 years old is originally from Messina and He is a management engineer with the innate passion of doing business after experiences in France and Luxembourg has decided to return to Italy to open his company in Milan you have access to an excellent international and European hub explains to 23 years Maurizio moved from Sicily In Lombardy to study at the Polytechnic of Milan a few months before the thesis accepts an exchange in France, it is there that signs its first permanent framework contract a few years after an experience in Luxembourg in the international marketing sector in what was my most Beautiful professional adventure as an employee in a famous Italian food company Read also veterinary in France in Italy unworthy proposals I had to say thank you to work for free who goes away like me is forced to do so then the decision to abandon his career abroad and to return after spending many hours to make slides for colleagues and customers Maurizio He thought of going to his own by returning to Italy and opening his startup I founded a consultancy company that deals with creating effective business presentations by applying specific methodologies explains Maurizio today is driving a team made up of ten people between employees and collaborators with headquarters in Milan and over 20 multinational customers between the USA Europe Canada China Hong Kong I have always had the dream of doing something of my say I love marketing the company and the brands I worked for inside me, however I always knew I wanted to create something that would allow you to allow you to express my pen I serve to create my ideas by challenging the market, being able to work without rules of spaces or times as well as directing his company Maurizio is a university professor at the Polytechnic of Milan and at the Marangoni Institute I try to give what I have not received and to share my experience By putting it at the service of the boys I love to always stay in contact with the world of startups for years I have been trying to support and improve the projects of the startups of Polhub L incubator of the business of the Polytechnic of Milan The classic work day even to talk about it to it constantly living at the Outside the routine if I can change the country at least once every 4 months by choice I do not have a type of work I can find myself teaching me to deal with the strategic and managerial part of my company or develop new products and services maybe I write a blog article or As today I answer the questions of an interview Read also I left Argentina to return to Italy to teach I was nostalgia at home and I managed to return because Italy for the strategic value of the Italy market to do business explains Maurizio Certainly it is a slightly complex market for international competitors and This means that the competition is low or nothing if you can introduce a truly innovative idea the country moves very slowly compared to many others in the world of startups and therefore you have the opportunity to see what happens outside you in short, you have time to learn and The place to experiment with life and salaries abroad of moreover are very different from Italy depends on the countries certainly tells Maurizio but it is not difficult to find situations with salaries two or three times higher and others where there is no taxation as regards the relationship with the own country the tone changes to Doro l Italy and I consider myself really lucky to be Italian but often I think it is not a competitive country to get the advice for young compatriots to experience abroad as soon as possible starting from the studies and above all before it is too late for Maurizio it is of a decision that can change your life and give you a lot but it is an opportunity that often fades because you tend to postpone Maurizio who has chosen to study in the North as soon as I was able to an entrepreneur fees for constant instability and feels a total disconnection professionally speaking from his country is therefore still in Italy because he not replies I think that he does not need to wait to do what you like and that regardless of everything you have to put yourself in a position to live every day of what makes us happy, but they must prepare concludes to a country that will not play on their side
 In Argentina, the funding for research are very few more you are far from everything and everyone is difficult to move for meetings or conferences, everything is much more complicated Antonio Ferramosca 39 years Apulian after his experiences in Spain first and then decided in Argentina To return to Italy together with Cecilia his wife and his two daughters today is a professor at the University of Bergamo but he does not hear a brain returned I needed to be able to go to a place that would allow me to do my job best explains and Italy is One of these originally from Maglie in the province of Lecce a three -year degree in computer engineering and a masterful at the University of Pavia Antonio went away for the first time in 2006 after winning a scholarship for a doctorate at the University of Seville in Spain from 2009 he had the opportunity to study for a semester at the University of Wision Madison USA in those months I have with A Argentine girl who then became my wife remembers Cecilia, after the end of the doctorate in 2011 Antonio and Cecilia decide to move to Argentina there I worked as a post doc first and a researcher then at the conicet L Argentine equivalent of our CNR tells also veterinary laws In France in Italy unworthy proposals I had to say thank you for free to work those who go away like me are forced to do it in Reconquista in the province of Santa Fe Antonio becomes a contract professor of systems and automatic controls at the National Technological University when I had to less Days became very long, the UTN national technological university was conceived at the end of the 1940s as a public university that could give workers the opportunity to study for this too explains Antonio. Or before 5pm I sometimes made lessons until midnight smiles for Antonio each country has its academic and university system in Argentina, unfortunately it is more difficult to do a job like mine the funding for research are very few in any case the level continues Of academic preparation is high, Argentina is chosen to study by many guys from South America, the cost of life in Argentina is lower than Italy explains and consequently also salaries The rent for the house but also meat fruit vegetables have a lower price the weight is a weak currency and the inflation touches peaks of the annual 55 which never corresponds to an increase in the salaries of the same proportions, on the contrary it comes to me that in Argentina the professors are silver and Italian underpaid explains the expat are very similar the Argentines are almost All grandchildren or principal of Italians and have a visceral love for Italy have well The stories of their grandparents or great -grandparents and an incredible desire for Italianness has imprinted this, however, this has done nothing but make me even more nostalgic smiles read also to London I work in finance I started from a cafeteria to pay the expenses if I think about the road I have I made the dizziness like this in 2020 after 9 years spent in South America Antonio together with his wife and his two daughters decides to return to Italy by winning a competition for a place as a professor at the engineering faculty of the University of Bergamo I would not use this word However, he replies I have never been able to feel comfortable in Argentina and I have always wanted and tried the way to be able to return to Italy Antonio would not define himself as a return brain you simply feel a lucky person who after so many years and different experiences abroad He wanted to be a family of friends of Amici to return to speak in his language to eat the dishes of Italian cuisine and had the opportunity to do so I am a person who had now nostalgia for Italy and who fortunately managed to return the future still imagines him In Bergamo doing what I like research and university teaching but with a few years more and the hair on one thing but Antonio has no doubt the Italian academic system is of the highest level among the best in Europe the training I received allowed me to do My work abroad and I have never felt late compared to colleagues from the rest of Europe or the United States certainly adds if it refers to the budget it is clear that the most important US universities have funds that Italian universities also excellence have never seen but this does not mean that the quality of teaching and research is lower here In Italy on the contrary, I conclude I can assure you that in my research field the Italians are among the best
 After graduation I found only short and free jobs in private clinics that I even had to tacit thanks for the possibility of giving experience for this seven years ago I decided to leave Chiara Calandra born in 1986 has always had Palermo and the physiology of the world in the heart Animal thus studied veterinary in Sicily and there he tried to stay but tired of precarious and almost free opportunities in 2013 he moved to France where he had recently had a son and works in various veterinary clinics in the Department of the Val D Oise in the le de France in the first months of Covid 19 I anxiously experienced the distance from home and the risk of not being able to see my family members in case of hospitalization or not being able to present them my son born in the middle of the pandemic then my mother managed to reach us and This has checked us his birth took place in the middle of the emergency my experience with French healthcare even during the Cov ID has been very positive, some measures have perhaps been read but overall in my opinion the system works also read in Denmark know that there is more efficiency if you spend less hours in the office my salary is the 60 more than Italian colleagues when clear It was in Italy to design a family was impossible because he could not give stability to those professional goals for which he had sweated so much I started working in Sicily accepting unworthy proposals when he was fine paid me a few hundred euros per month without protections and without rights after a Po I understood that for Italian veterinarians the labor market is non -existent then he made his luggage and went to France where a colleague had won a place and where he knew that he could also find something here the faculties of veterinary medicine I am only four or and they are called Grandes coles Higher Education in which the students I love to define war machines are gradually accompanied by the theory to practice his first stop was Nantes came as a tinning pupil then I had a fixed -term contract as a resident specializing in An international path called Residency in Clinical Nutrition The approach was not simple and integrate at all immediate I knew only English and at the school level so I warned the bubble of linguistic isolation then the hardness of the climate the economic difficulties and social relationships that slowly gear me me They put to the test but with a little tenacity, the work possibilities also favored his life path after a period in Nantes I went to clinical and diagnostic activities in the Paris region where I now work with a permanent contract Chimera For many with Legs and peers left in Italy, read also in Bristol, we bought a house and put on the family in Italy if they can make you apprenticeship contracts up to 40 years the difference in the profession is substantial Italian veterinarians often leave the university without knowing how to deal with a case clinical up to the degree tells I did not see a patient The insertion in practice was very violent and I had to do my bones alone in France instead there is a path created ad hoc for undergraduates the students here meet the first patients in the fourth year diagnostic and through a hierarchical system are oriented to reflect on the clinical case with the supervision of different senior figures ranging from the internal veterinary medicine specialist to the assistant responsible for the department to the professor but Chiara who does not consider himself a brain on the run It is keen to clarify me indignation to hear about brain escape, it almost seems that the responsibility is of those who go away as if it stole a preparation for Italy which then spends their opinion elsewhere is clear to nobody likes to abandon their land and face the inconvenience of a life initially harsh and disadvantaged to go away is always traumatic but it is never said that those who go away is forced to do it certain there is those who emigrate by choice to look for better opportunities abroad but in my case she says the cultural divestment begins from Sicilian University I systems of untouchable power where it almost seems to be a career for family law, read in London I work in finance I started from a cafeteria to pay the expenses if I think about the road I made I have the dizziness for his experience abroad this does not c  or alm Eno is not so evident and if it arrived far away it was not thanks to the formation made in Italy when I arrived in France I was a precarious hesitation and with a pharaonic but totally theoretical preparation the difference with Italy is that in France everything is more regular the job It is well planned and protected and I feel inserted in a professional logic suitable here the remuneration is congruous with my responsibilities the progress of the salary progresses with experience and I was given the opportunity to demonstrate my working skills perhaps also thanks to the stability achieved in These years in France and the prospects of a long -term career today Chiara and her French companion have put on the family in Italy says the economic and working realization was too unstable to build a life project to my baby I will teach love for mine originate my land the Sicily in which unfortunately I will return only to find the my family and make my children know their natural beauties

more safe I pulled out the tripod in case Of an aggression sometimes the night could be felt shifted but the commitment and sacrifice reward him arrives the contract if you commit yourself and you want to make a career this is a country that can offer a lot here unlike Italy the majority of the population sees the Journalism as a real profession and is paid in 2018 after various services from

Switzerland in the salon where he has been working since August 2019 and who says to be the best place where Andrea has ever been eight different shops at 16 years of age I started a private school in Modena but it lasted more years and I was in a hurry to learn the trade like this later A few months I found one in Bologna only a year to take hand with a hairdryer and brushes but the school is not always enough as many colleagues in Italy Andrea decides to work on the weekend in a small living room in Modena living to commute after a few months I left the school tells I had found a full -time job but it was a small -run room Fam Il Posto explains Andrea does not allow him to grow and so on his career as soon as the hairdresser has started again salon I found a place in a prominent place with a part time contract The pay is 500 euros per month and so Andrea to live alone rent A small studio apartment a laundry as he says at a cost of 250 euros per month but I was happy he tells

was 3 years told I tried to assert myself a Being part of something beautiful even doing many hours a week but there was never a gratification was as if they did a favor to them the main problem tells it is the difficulty of understanding between the adult world and that of young people who approach the work above all Specifies for a sector like his at the beginning it is physiological to proceed by degrees instead explains there since I was good in some services such as the male cut they parked me without making me grow without investing in practice it is as if they had told me do that hello and goodbye and For a young man he is frustrating is only after yet another part time work paid in black and moreover s Enza of the established times but on call that Andrea decides to leave I tried to stay telling the employer to make me at least a part of the contract but he replied no so at almost 25 years with a backpack on his shoulder and 150 curriculum in his hand Andrea He left for Ticino I was for a while in a hostel in the morning I woke up and went around for salons after turning them around almost all but they only called me in two the work offered is not stable but only a replacement of a day the search continues Without stopping not only in Lugano but also in Locarno and Bellinzona and the offer after a while he arrives called me a gentleman for a new lounge lounge telling immediately the difference in treatment gave me the keys to the salon from the first day trusting and made me Immediately a full time contract 3800 francs gross, that is, about 3400 euros unthinkable in Italy still explains incredulous, however telling of an environment with one Provincial mentality when the owner decided to install cameras tells Andrea I didn't feel comfortable anymore and so after three years I left with the residence permit and a year of work behind but Switzerland does not abandon you but you It helps to reintegrate yourself into work in practice give you the 70 80 of your salary explains Andrea you have a kind of tutor that follows you and helps you and every day you have to bring the curriculum at least to a shop to show that you have engaged in search for each curriculum that you carry you have to make you make a kind of stamp and all the documents must then be delivered to the coordinator, however, the system is efficient and provides in the event that it is impossible to find work in your sector also a series of training courses to try in other fields after a while Andrea is again on the track I moved to Zurich and in the new salon they immediately hired me full time after six months But they told me that I was not in line with their style but after a few months he finds another opportunity the environment is familiar but it is a chain of four salons we do shooting events fashion show and I feel that it is my place all goes to great training e Personal growth are insured and the salary is also in line with the Swiss national collective agreement about 4000 francs gross plus the extras in case of extraordinary the only drawback is the language I speak English and for them it is fine because it is an international environment but in Zurich we speak German and learning it is not easy tells the idea of ??returning to Italy for now is not at the horizon after more than 10 years of work, five of which in Switzerland Andrea should in fact find a lounge proportionate to his experience and the possibilities are minimal in a normal place mi mi they would pay the minimum union -scable like a thousand euros and it would always be a battle of the hope of being able to return one day c It is always because it says Italy is my home is my lifestyle to the question if the relationship between the cost of life and the salary is advantageous Andrea has no doubt, I pay no rent the rent 1000 francs but the bills for example are lower explains in Each case the game in Italy would not be worth the candle look at abroad and think what I am doing in Italy the past I just think I have wasted time

Fear hope so the Italians abroad who told their stories in IlFattoquotidiano it live the days of the emergency linked to Covid 19 by Australia where roads and parks are still full of people at Japan where everything seems normal to pass for the delay of two weeks In the activation of the measures of the London government in Spain and the United States totally unprepared until Scotland who underestimated the problem, here are their voices laws also Coronavirus the expats in Sweden we would like to be in Italy the state is silent on intensive care places and closes anything We are afraid there is those who already in early February like Andrea Pedicini Real Estate Broker in New York on the basis of what was happening in Italy decided to stay at home with wife and children avoiding contacts I tried to explain to Amici and Colleghi America ni the severity of the situation tells Andrea the United States have struggled to take note of the emergency also because of the reluctance of the federal government to carry out the tests for several weeks unfortunately there is still no full awareness of the seriousness of the virus both from a point of view Healthcare that social continues on the weekend of March 22, the main parks of the city were still full of people, Luca Masetti Masetti in Melbourne remained in Australia who, however, recalls that many people were forced to return home because funds were made available for citizens and permanent residents but not for the temporary residents who are a very important slice of the population I am lucky says why I continue to receive my scholarship from the university but many here including my roommates have been fired and have no money to pay the expenses or the rent if in Japan for now everything seems normal s fold Giuseppe Bonfitto C is those who like Federico Rota Informatico landed in Madrid in early March and seemed to have arrived in Wonderland recalls the first interventions were taken decidedly late when I had already armored at home on my own speech for Luca Longo Engineer in Madrid we live closed in the house we leave only to shop tells many not if many friends pass it well have been suspended from work until June while others have moved on to the remote working with mountain hours and halved salary Spain reacted badly He adds I think it is the worst one of the European countries at the end of February, the Spaniards did not know that the emergency existed were totally out of the world until mid -March everything was normal football matches concerts concerts full of people then came down the chaos they were not prepared even in Scotland at the beginning it seemed that he did not seriously take the Problem tells Maria Lisa Di Lanzo Professor in Glasgow in Italy I had quarantine friends but here everything was normal and I continued to go to work the situation then changed completely and within a few days the government proclaimed the Lockdown I did not believe but there is So much solidarity adds my husband is an employee of the NHS The National Health Service yesterday were all at the windows to applaud them La Scotland became a more emotional country because everyone in one way or another have or have also been affected by the Italian cronavirus abroad I positively positive In the hospital in Berlin to be buffer for the general practitioner, there was only influence C and finally those who were forced to stay in Italy in early March I was busy as the first violin with the Orchestra del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino and about to return to London remember Fabriz I have been contacted by the direction of the Philharmonic Orchestra management, considering that I remained in my country from the information that Fabrizio receives daily from colleagues and friends from London emerge strong concerns for the slowness and superficiality of the government in taking adequate measures to counter the epidemic the future For now he is only put aside Maria Lisa does not see the time to return to Italy to embrace her family Fabrizio has been canceled concerts and tour all over the world Andrea sees large opportunities in New York from here to the next few months for Luca There will be the greatest post -war economic crisis that will affect our habits and the way of being Federico finally thinks that little or nothing will change for now I continue to work even if it is necessary to be aware that companies cannot pay the infinite people who make half my thoughts conclude goes to who it is On their own to professionals to the operators to the many Italians who work in catering as far as they can go on
 We went back from Milan only with a one -way ticket we do not know when nor how we can return but here in Spain people are more paranoid than the Italians Lucas Mauri at this one should be in Erasmus in Milan and instead speaks in insulation from his home a Valencia will have to stay there for 14 days as the Spanish Ministry of Health said even if within the next two days an ambulance will arrive at home to undergo the test for the Coronavirus is 20 years old studies tourism and had started in September Milan University Bicocca 29 June 2020 date scheduled for the return then passed by the events since on February 25, I landed in Spain I lived in the Puccini residence in Sesto San Giovanni we were in 25 Spaniards and we all returned home we studied in Bicocca Cattolica Politecnico Statale I also know about French and Poles that They are repatriated to the residence remained those who work because otherwise it remains unemployed m In I also heard some friends who were at the international domus all returned home and the Spaniards there were more than 25 only two girls from Argentina and US And on Sunday when we saw the measures introduced by the Lombardy Region by the University first they told us that the lessons were suspended for the week then until March 2 they write to us every day from the university keep us very informed, the out of the location that In addition to those of Novara Bergamo and Brescia Lucas came from southern Italy, he returned like the others quickly without the time to greet the friends of the semester looking for a return ticket was a big expense to buy a direct flight was too expensive I did Malpensa Barcelona for 200 euros then with a train I went to Valencia in Malpensa nobody checked it in entry and nobody above all has it Checking in Barcelona I know about friends who have had checks at the entrance to Bergamo airport we ask Lucas if the fears and episodes of panic in Italy relating to the contagions were in his perception boundlessly not if in Spain there was the same number Of cases that you have the situation would be much heavier, the Spaniards are increasingly exaggerated than the Italians but in the media that space occupies the news on the crownavirus on television here we do not speak of anything else both on the local networks and on the national teams people are very afraid and Much more than the Italians in Milan life continued normally at least in Valencia then there is an extra problem that feeds fear which on Wednesday 19 February c was in San Siro Atalanta Valencia with 2500 Spanish away C is a lot of concern fear that Lucas has perceived Even on the return I feel that there is discrimination against us because we are back from Italy there is who there ch Iede where we go what we are doing if we are at home if we did the test to the mother of a friend of mine too he too returned from Milan like me the doctor said why he had gone to him since he had touched his son he lives in a village near Cuenca The more the countries are smaller these episodes are frequent Lucas is fine but the test will do so has called the dedicated number to get information on what he should return but they told him that he will have to wait an ambulance at home will arrive there they will make him the test and If negative can stop self -isolation at the moment, everything is suspended a ticket to return to Milan I don't have who knows if I will be able to finish the Erasmus updated to February 28, 2020 at 16 32
Germany for Ignazio Capici was a starting point and an arrival point feels Italian German European double citizenship and double language all began in Cologne Ignazio was born here in 1985 from Sicilian parents who emigrated time before then the return to Italy where it remains for More than 10 years when I was 8 years old I retraced in Italy together with my family my mother and father thought that after years of sacrifices it would be possible to start a life path in Sicily again but Ignatius does not go so much scientific maturity and In 2006 the whole family returned to Germany to Cologne, also read engineer and data scientist in Belgium, Italy did not give me what I deserved love for myself makes me stay here now in the country where all three and three Ignatius are born The third largest city in Bavi moved to Augusta It was where she lives with her girlfriend she too studied in nursing Italy while her parents stopped in Cologne when we returned I started working as a waiter then in 2011 I did the competition for the German railways and I won it thus begins his own Controller period on high -speed trains that continues until 2016 in that year a three -year Degree Bachelor Degree Degree begins by the company paid by the company a sort of alternation school work I attended the 50 of the lessons at the Ludwig Maximilians University in Monaco for the rest I learned working On the field, he concludes training in 2019, now he is personnel director or as the station manager is called in Germany in my case in Munich and manages an international team of 60 people, we deal with the relationship with the customers of the hiring of suppliers is the work so they formed me and like me Read also Prof in England here no rankings and in class the students are involved in practical activities in Italy, on the other hand, the teacher speaks to the first subject of his business economy degree adds a second Italian linguistics in Germany it is normal alongside another to the main one of the path I chose the study of my native speaker of studies, but in the newspaper speaks little at work only English and German in particular if I did not know English I would be cut off from the world because I work with people who come from different countries a good knowledge of this language is a lot Diffused had immediately noticed him on his return to Bavaria when I returned in 2006 the comparison with the others regardless of their level of education was heavy everyone spoke very well now for work reasons I go to England once per year Where I follow language courses to maintain a good level the expenses thinks about it, the company instead uses Italian to write for a few months has collaborated sporadically with the Italo German newspaper Deutsch Italia based in Berlin, read even at 50 we reinvented in Valencia we wanted to return In Rome but too many taxes in Italy is impossible once a month Monaco is not far away and it is well connected thanks to the trains for this reason it is said that it is the city further north of Italy, the Sicily has remained more distant as well as its country of origin barrafranca enna I lack especially the friends I met at school are very intense ties and finding similar ones is difficult even if here in Bavaria they are not only if the past has been a swing between Germany and Italy the future seems stable in German land I see it here above all for the o psality that I had a managerial position is not at least not for every day not for me the Bavaria is dear and inserting itself has not been simple says but offers social safety high health safety and organization in the workplace now if I see that some processes are too slow I work as a German and I try to speed them up
  The truth is that I will discourage my daughters to make the researchers unless they decide to leave abroad repeats it several times and with regret Marilena Ciciarello the 43 -year -old Italian scientist winner in 2019 and for the second time the first in 2015 of the Ash Giuseppe Bigi Memorial Award Award with his study on mechanisms that feed Leucemia with him during the 61st Congress of the Ash American Society of Hematology which was held from 7 to 10 December in Orlando in Florida a double recognition that is worth gold in the The United States while in Italy passes almost unnoticed award -winning the foreign to the Institute of Hematology Seragnoli of the University Hospital of Santo Orsola Malpighi in Bologna Marilena Ciciarello shouts at the injustice abroad, the work as a researcher is among the most appreciated works among the most prestigious ones in Italy Instead it is considered almost a hobby not a real profession To be clear, my manager who lasted one of the first experiences in the laboratory had the courage when I presented myself in his studio to ask him for a salary as he promised to tell me that I cannot expect so much because the researcher is known to be a son of Dads also Italians abroad out of 14 thousand returned with tax incentives half has divided and the rules are a labyrinth today Marilena mother of two daughters carries on her research thanks to a contract with the ail Italian association against leukemias lymphomas and myeloma through The program adopts a researcher expiring in May but as they promised her, Marilena's adopted mother will be renewed she is a French lady who has lived in Bologna for many years and her name is Marie Paule Vedrine every now and then we feel she came here I presented her the My project I keep it informed about how it proceeds and thank you in my publications Marilena every year must hope for a renewal has been for six years one of the many researchers recipients of the research allowance as required by the Gelmini law of 2010 but that once the 6 have passed years fall in precariousness if for those like us there is no one to have an ad hoc solution we will be out forever read my career in the school via Da Sicilia wonderful land destined for forfeiture but there is more the worst thing is that with my contract not It is possible to access the research funds made available by private or public agencies because you are not institutionally anyone for the hospital or for the university the researcher of Bologna with Calabrian origins feels abandoned for years the research does not fall within the plans of the governments for this I was you Nita to give up everything and yet his is a respectable curriculum, indeed more he studied at the Sapienza University of Rome where he graduated in Biology and then made a doctorate in genetics and molecular biology and a specialization in genetics applied after a period in the capital In a CNR National Research Council Laboratory with a Stock Exchange of the AIRC Italian Association for Research against FIRC Cancer in 2009, he moved to the Institute of Ematology Seragnoli in Bologna where he worked in the cell therapy laboratory directed by Antonio Curti Operational Unit of Hematology led by Michele Cavo first with a 3 -year contract and then with a research grant obtained with the Gelmini reform and finally the agreement with the AIL read also in the office in Basel no infinite hours in Sicily after graduation I felt hopeless or hopefully future Because therefore not to leave Italy and run away abroad, I consider myself a researcher who knows how to do his job and for this I would like to continue to do it in Italy here I built my family I have two daughters and a husband transfer everyone abroad it would be a problem and then The news of the new recognition All Ash has given me some charge but I admit that I thought about the possibility of changing the way since in the meantime I have also taken a master's degree in nutrition, however, I wonder if it is right that people like me who dedicated me more than twenty years in research live a sense of abandonment that they have to surrender
 I looked for work in Italy but either I was too qualified or I had little more experience the few positions I was fine for were barely paid, Italy formed me like few educational systems in the world could have done but it is not able to give me the same Belgium opportunities when eight years ago left Avola the Syracusan municipality in which Paola Masuzzo has grown today Data Scientist in Ghent nodded the air well to carry a little of the scent of almonds and a house of his house was 26 years old a degree in engineering Electronics at the University of Catania and a specialist in biomedical engineering at the Sapienza of Rome finished with a master's thesis in the laboratories of the Utah University in the USA but Italy had nothing to offer them after graduation I returned to Rome and I started looking for open job Even to the possibility of doing a doctorate of research, however, I almost immediately discarded the idea given the very low funds pre Seen for PhD students in Italy, read Prof in England here, no ranking and in class, the students are involved in practical activities in Italy instead speaks the teacher today is 35 years old and lives in Ghent where he has achieved a research doctorate and a postdotler in bioinformatics To then become a given scientist for an independent multinational and researcher at the Institute for Globally Distributed Open Research and Education Igore I did not want to return to the United States where I had worked for the master's thesis but it was clear that my country was unable to give me what I wanted and that I was sure to deserve so he began looking elsewhere a university willing to finance his future I took life and courage with two hands and I started sending my curriculum to all European universities who had research programs in L Inea with my studies and my skills after a few interviews on Skype I ended up in Belgium in the picturesque ghent a city he fell in love with at first sight for someone like her who loves to travel Ghent is the ideal city because she is at the center of Europe and He has excellent tourist plans but setting off was not easy for certain days I would have liked to give up everything and return to Sicily I missed the sun my family the bidet the spontaneity of the Italians that the Flemish people do not know and does not share this, however, is a bit the price from pay for having managed to follow my dreams and partly to make them a doctorate of paid research dignified a university experience full of professional growth opportunities and personal a job today one to whom I can best employ my intellectual resources read even at 50 years We are reinvented in Valencia Vole I have to return to Rome but it is impossible too many taxes if I think back to when he arrived perfectly reminds the feeling once he gets out of the train two suitcases a little tired so much curiosity a little healthy fear but above all a sense of revenge that then served me and me It is still needed to face the most difficult days those rainy and cold darkness to leave Sicily first and then Italy was not easy but to make the engineer and being a woman can be equally complicated and Paola understood it well while he did an examination at the University of Catania I think a Jurassic professor was 70 without even listening to my first answer, Signorina told me at home must be shopping and luckily cooking the young assistant intervened and continued the exam in her place after Catania according to Paola the situation of the engineer woman is the same everywhere and has to do with the culture of the profession rather than with the discriminations ni in the workplace women in my field are few this unfortunately still depends on the sector and it is a bit the same in each country but excluding the episode in the three -year being a woman has never been made to me or notice or weigh I have always been first What engineer then woman I have never heard discrimination neither to the university nor in the company also read my career in the school away from Sicily wonderful land destined for forfeiture, however, it has heard that towards families C is attention to what in Italy is missing in welfare and support To the parents who want to make a career Flemish policies for work are excellent I have time and flexible ways to devote to family friends and interests here are all efficient but there is great attention to personal needs in addition to the career in Ghent Paola has found her Flemish husband so much gent And he asks me if he remained in Belgium for love and with great serenity and security I am always ready to say that yes for the love for myself of dreams to be realized still someone is there and to the possibility of returning home he never has I would like to give up all I would like to bring everything I learned abroad back to Sicily perhaps working for a non -profit organization like L Open Data Sicily remains to be understood if I will be going to Palermo or the open date Sicily to move to Belgium
At school he had never seen a computer and today he is a computer rewarded by Facebook Pasquale Salza 31 years old researcher in the engineering of the software originally from Ariano Irpino in the province of Avellino today works for the University of Zurich in a team that takes care of the development of software e Their ease of use at the University of Salerno I had an excellent preparation I cannot complain about anything now I want to create bridges and collaborations between the International University of Pasquale has studied at the University of Salerno where the master's degree has taken the three -year degree and the doctorate in computer sciences enabled himself by Then at the exercise of the profession during the doctorate participated in a Summer School dedicated to the software engineering an opportunity to deepen the topic but also to create relationships here he meets an Italian professor with a chair in Lugano who offers him the opportunity to work on a his project after an experience all university  di Dublin and one at the Mit of Boston Pasquale makes the suitcases for Switzerland where the post -doctorate post begins on the one hand was a natural continuation of the doctorate regardless of the career in Italy to have an experience abroad is always well seen another reason was that Economic I do not hide that salaries travel on two different lengths is now in Zurich where he is a researcher in software engineering his team deals with simplifying the development of the extra software keeps the course of Advanced Software Engineering for the Master's Master students and Follows Tessens and PhD students



is very good comments in the Universities of northern Europe the teachings are more practical and prepare more immediately to the world of work we go out of universities with a Excellent theoretical base that in the long run can be an advantage because it allows you to be versatile and adaptable to different contexts The problem if anything is the lack of investments in research Switzerland invests 3 6 of the GDP Italy L 1 3 A third in any company Switzerland, the doctorate is assessed as a good position of the start in Italy, the PHD often has no added value compared to the degree, you write overqualification and yes there Egge is too qualified for this work in Italy, the main outlet of a degree in computer science is the advice or processing of the databases now with the arrival of the web giants something is changing but if the research and development sector is neglected not It allows you to conquer qualifications, however, explains Salza the research is done also good for international scientific conferences I see a flood of Italians there are good researchers but often they do it as individuals not in teams as they are intended abroad there are also few funds destined for the Research also Prof in England here no rankings and in class the students are involved in practical activities in Italy instead speaks the teacher today Pasquale is happy with his job it is hardly happening that I go to work discontent and this is a great thing he admits I know I would like to stay in Switzerland in Zurich, I feel good for both the university environment and the quality of life here there is the space to build a career there are funding funding to the projects of the individual researchers The downside the medal is that an ultra -common environment taken Mira da tutt Europe even from the US would like to return to stay close to the family but the conditions are not favorable at the moment I don't think I would go to the happy job as I go here I exclude companies a priori because I feel more brought for the academic environment where But there are few places tells of many of his former colleagues scattered around the world and the few remain in Italy and at rather disadvantageous conditions an infinite expectation and then receiving a salary that is not adequate for your preparation the average of the salary of a research assignist who It is the Italian fee of what I do here is 1500 EU Ro in Salerno I would live well in Milan no in Zurich despite the high cost of life with what I earn I can live quietly to put something aside and take away some whim every now and then read even at 50 at the age of 50 we reinvented in Valencia we wanted to return to Rome but it is Impossible too many taxes and thinking that at school it did not even do an hour of computer science have taught me very well the mathematics but I have never seen a computer in the classroom now I see much more interest from elementary a teacher with a more specific preparation also in superiors not Always those who teach this subject have a degree in computer information or engineering Pasquale has participated as a teacher in the computer courses provided for by the PON, that is, the national operational plan financed with European funds the key to bringing the little ones closer to such a complex subject Sa explains is the gamification as a video game enthusiast I have always believed in the playful aspect and it works well also in the education when I entered the classroom I was in front of pupils with very low computer skills if not nulle then to bring them closer to computer I used games created with scratch the environment of free programming that allows you to create interactive stories games and animations editor's note thus enjoyed and in the meantime they learned how to give commands to the algorithm today's children are able to use tablets and apps already as children but they are mechanical gestures that certainly require intelligence but little have To do with computational thought, read also engineer in France in Italy I sent 70 curriculum here in one day I had an indefinite contract for his research work was also awarded by a giant de The web L Mark Zuckerberg Company Facebook invests a lot in research asks researchers to offer projects with application perspectives for their products I participated in a tender on the testing practically the software crash test to see if a program behaves in the expected way He developed a proposal with two other people one of his former doctoral teacher and a colleague of Lugano ideally connecting his two old universities on over 100 Facebook projects has rewarded 10 including that of Pasquale Salza Facebook financed the project and you can decide how to spend We have decided to transfer them to

In Amsterdam if you don't park your bikes in the racks you kidnaps you the municipality that prayed to them in a park outside the city an all -wheel expanse of which it is impossible to find the end when Vito Mastrorocco if it is seen in front of it has lost hopes I was In Holland recently and I still did not understand some rules of the city such as the bike parking spaces seized me two in ten days reminds the park, he had gone to recover them knowing that he would have to pay first a fine but find them in the myriad of bicycles he had below The eyes seemed to say the least unlikely to the reception because there was also a reception showed that they were card and photographed they found mine in a few minutes I paid 15 euros for bikes and I went away with both above all he learned to park them in the way Giusto Vito arrived in Amsterdam for the first time in 2013 to write the thesis after five years of Universa In Italy now at 33 years old he deals with international taxation and works in a large Dutch banking group he started from the province of Bari and a few years earlier he had already broughts his suitcases to go to Erasmus in Stettino in Poland the first period in Holland ended a lot Well I met what is now my wife remembers the research returns to Puglia where a year remains a year graduates and starts the direction always north always the Netherlands for the first seven months in order to keep yourself doing everything waiter pizza make -up in the meantime looking for work finds it in A Japanese company that deals with taxation and finance where it will remain for four years has been the first impact with a highly international work environment I was an Italian transferred to Holland who worked for Japanese 1 5 behind it has a practiced in Italy in Bari unpaid I am not the only one I know it happens to many of not receiving even a refund expenses in Holland instead such a thing is not possible if a salary is works there is always to hit it are above all the spirit of collaboration and the courtesy of his colleagues from whom he feels welcomed the same thing happens in 2018 when he passes to the Dutch banking group here follow him in his professional growth now the job takes him around the EU ropa but says it is not like traveling a plane in the morning the arrival in the office and another flight in the evening to return home and the Italy I come back about four times per year I try to stop especially in the summer of my Puglia I miss the sun and the sea Instead, those who consider the two problems of the Belpaese was gladly left behind the bad politics and above all the normalization of corruption now seems obvious to find it wherever there is business is worth then being in Holland says Vito even if with friends it is not always easy While at work the Dutch welcome foreigners with open arms in the relational field tend to keep the distances but it does not feel only because the beauty of Amsterdam is that it makes you know many cultures many lives is an international center that puts you in contact with the rest of the world it is enough to be a bit curious but returning to the two wheels the bikes steal them even there certain that they steal them laughs then they resell them happen that the owner finds them on the black market and then there is the legend that so much legend is not there are more bikes in the channels than in the streets

The master's degree and an internship of six months abroad in France in one of the largest companies in the aeronautical sector seventy curriculum sent and no response I was shocked as it is possible that such an experience in such a prestigious company counted nothing for Marina Bruno engineer Lecce of 32 years of finding a job in Italy was almost impossible while with a recruiting day in France the permanent contract has arrived with the company where I still work today I miss but I go back only for the holidays I am bitter for poor consideration Received in Italy my future I am building it here also at 50 at the age of 50 we reinvented ourselves in Valencia we wanted to return to Rome but it is impossible too many marine taxes studied IT engineering in Lecce and then it specialized in management engineering at the Polytechnic of Bari Reality in contact with various companies abroad among the possible destinations C was an important aeronautical company that proposed an internship relevant to the cryogenic processing that it was the object of my degree thesis so I proposed I made the interviews and I was taken 1 4 In 2017 he packs his bags and moves beyond the Alps remembering that experience shining his eyes I could not believe it was one of the most important companies in the world when I arrived there the vision of the planes took my breath away a real emotionDuring the six months spent in France he graduated and with the approach of the return he begins to look for work in Italy there is nothing like Salento his sun his people the baroque the heat does not find it in one other place in the world tells smiling I never could imagine in a company so far from home two thousand kilometers away from my family and from my affections he takes the account of the companies contacted on an Excel sheet in the end he sends 70 candidates but no one goes to the port 90 did not respond at all the remaining 10 was no longer interested in time passed the more I realized that my experience in this large company was not evaluated adequately and this poor consideration embittered me then Marina is contacted by a company that received its curriculum through the Job Placement service of the University but in the same period I participated in a recruiting day so I found myself with two P Act of contract in hand one in France and one in Italy, read also doctors fleeing from Italy to make them stay, you need more highly access to specialization and career prospects, the plan is to return home but when it compares the contracts the differences The French offer are evident not only provided for 500 euros more per month but proposed an indefinite contract immediately instead of growing protections and therefore I thought of returning to Italy I chose to start here with a higher salary than my remaining colleagues In Italy and above all with more protections another thing he remembers is that no one in France gave them personal questions to the interview in Italy ask you why you graduated late here they look at what you can do now Marina live near Nantes and works in a Consulting Company for Engineering where it deals with the supply chain, that is, the flow of material between his company and the suppers C is more work but also more competition between Saint Nazaire and Nantes there are many industrial centers the assignment that you waste you take another engineer on the fly, read the Sicily is intended for bankruptcy, the recommendation also applies to cleaning the toilets there has found a companion of friends a perspective of the future has a stable job and in free time it volunteers with the first aid in northern France loves landscapes and the opening of people not They are friendly like us Italians but they are welcoming when I arrived I did not speak French they gave me a hand I met I was impressed by the respect of the rules and the multiculturalism on the bus meet people of different ethnic groups and religions is never a problem the level of integral One and respect that C is here also surprised the friends who came to see me Marina wants to dispel the stereotype of the Italians good people and the French French really love my land but I would like that in Italy there was also the sense of community that I found here people smile at you more thank you respect the rules behind the wheel and in any other area this in my opinion is the key to civil coexistence I would like to see more than this sense of humanity also in Italy says that every summer takes three weeks of Holidays to return to Salento to breathe the air of the house I miss Salento but I am rooting here he says with a tip of bitterness I don't think I can return to Italy
Starting again from 50 years of age to learn a new job to move to a new continent Cristina Griffo 51 years and two children did it and now a year after the big jump it is said very happy I spent half of my life in Rome and half in Venezuela the Dream was to return to Rome but it was almost impossible to open a small activity too many taxes so we started a new life in Spain that welcomed us with kindness and availability now Cristina's family has lived in Valencia for a year where the youngest daughter manages a coffee goes At school and the eldest son studies wisdom in Rome with the idea of ??reaching them once the university is over 1 7 Cristina's bar in Valencia The story of Cristina born and raised in Rome starts from a uncle who made luck in Venezuela and who leaves the company to his brother the Father of Cristina in 1995 also who is 24 years old at the time he reaches him in South America followed by his boyfriend and have two children and for 23 years work in the family business I practically lived half of my life in Italy and the other half in Venezuela but When we could leave for Rome at least once a year I saw them change with the eyes of those who are outside the situation so it is more shiny sees a city that becomes more and more complex and tiring but Rome remains the dream of the house where to return especially when the situation In Venezuela he becomes tense with the great crisis that impoverishes the country and the extending of the Maduro regime we had reached the point where we were worried about our safety we were frightened we sent the eldest son to Rome to study there the girl was practically afraid to getting out of dear remaining was a struggle but even leaving was not easy from an economic point of view the savings of The one life had devalued themselves with the Venezuela in decadence Rome was our dream like this and the husband get to the table and try to make ends meet the accounts are wondering we can allow us to return to Italy to live in the capital to obtain a license and be able to pay The taxes no with the tax burden so high would have been impossible then we thought of Valencia we already knew the language and we had friends there also read my career in the school away from Sicily wonderful land destined for the decadence leave for a first trip to Spain of pleasure but also of exploration and fall in love they find a welcoming green city organized in a livable word Valencia is a quarter of Rome but it has nine lines of metro I saw how clean they add Cristina and an infinite fabric of cycle paths Cristina and the husband remains They are surprised above all by the kindness of public officials I am not talking about one person in particular but about the attitude of all those with whom we interacted to the doors accompany you to explain to you advise you in short, they help you in Rome this attention to the citizen is rare goods here is the norm Here the state really simplifies your life even when it comes to dealing with the bureaucracy necessary to open an activity here there are no licenses explain there are specialized agencies that contact those who give in the business and those who want to detect it and there is no need to buy The walls if you do not want in common c is an office dedicated to this kind of transitions where they tell you if the place is in accordance with or C is some problem to be placed in short, everything you need to know like this detects a bar must learn the profession from chief with dedication and patience says that the Spaniards also have a great culture of coffee and how The Italians do not settle on fresh bread and ham the secret of the perfect Bocadillo but now after a year he says it is happy with how things are going I have reinvented myself at 50 is a demanding job. Customers are demanding but it's nice to stay here and see the People who stop and speak to read Sicily is also destined for failure, the recommendation also applies to cleaning the toilet the eldest son in Italy does not see the time to reach them, he likes wisdom very much is a prestigious university but here he is freer to move and To return late in the evening without difficulty the youngest daughter goes to school and is happy because the insertion was simple and Valencia says is a city suitable for child attentive to the environment and all over the inclusion are much ahead of us on ecology for example are very attentive to recycling and then I see of the true Integration so much respect for diversity, the boys feel they express themselves as they want according to Cristina l Italy has nothing to learn from other states but could start copying some models that work to our policy is missing love and respect for our country Corruption The recommendations are all ways to make personal interest prevail over the common good Spain will have its defects but it is a respect for the rules and a lot of meritocracy the thing that has affected it most in this year is the myth of Italy sculpted In the imagination of the older Spaniards after Franco's dictatorship when we had to reconstruct Spain looked to us as a model were the years of the boom considered us unattainable but now not only did they reach us they really exceeded us
 In my family there was the idea that dreams are dreams and that you have to learn art and put it aside without ever chasing their passions but coming here in the United States I understood that dreams can be realized just to commit to the end and believe it Sara Alessandrini comes from Cesena is 31 years old and from four lives in Los Angeles where thanks to tenacity and passion for cinema he managed to become facility manager of the Egyptian Theater The oldest Hollywood projection room was born in the 20s told at the time they gave The same film for a year in front of the screen C was a small stage and before each screening they staged a show Sara on the phone describes a magical place with a large courtyard to host events outside and an internal setting in full Hollywood style as soon as there is I entered I understood that it was my place tells that, however, that it was not easy to get there

Sara was almost an obsession Watch vo le soap operates as paths and I recreated all the stories by reciting this instinct to cinema was not a walk especially because it tells Romagna is a very technical land here are all accounting mechanical whitewasheds says thus also explaining its choice to attend first L Industrial Technical Institute and then the Faculty of Engineering with the intent to become a teacher I was the only female in a class of males always pampered and with good votes but the skills acquired at the time have been very useful after almost three years of engineering attended by giving few Exams by reading secretly under the books of politics and contemporary history and keeping himself by making the bellhop of pizzas at home Sara decides to cultivate his passion for cinema and for what I revolve around I often went alone to the cinema and even I had put a television in the car so as I delivered pizzas I could see movies and then it was the same period in which Mariastella Gelmini announced cuts to teaching so I said to myself if I have to choose a difficult road at this point I chase my dream, cinema tells it is October 2010 when Sara leaves the village in the province of Cesena to move In Rome in Cinecitt where he enrolled in the academy of cinema with generic address was a beautiful school but managed badly so much that now it no longer exists telling the last few months you had to choose a sector and I in the end I chose video and sound assembly also read radiologist in Finland in Italy give you scholarships at 30 years of age here we work here but it is time for family and hobby to work in Italy in the world of cinema even if you come from a Cinecitt school is not as beautiful as everyone thinks there are specific universities even in Colombia tells amareggiat In Sara while in Italy or take a diploma like mine which, however, is not recognized or equated to a faculty or critical studies which, however, is different in any case the Academy Fruit to Sara the first contacts and the first works some totally free to learn the profession Others paid miserably is in Boston where Sara moves for a month to go and find a friend who understands that all dreams can be realized by Boston I went to New York to a charity event organized by the protagonists of the fiction path that day I have I understand that it is not so difficult to realize dreams I understood how powerful I could also be read to form us research doctors the state spends 400 thousand euros each but we are precarious unemployed or brains to escape almost a year after that trip after an unhappy parenthesis in Australia in March in 2015 he manages to move to the United States to Los Angeles to get the one -year working visa I enrolled in a generic course of Entertainment Studies three evenings per week but given my stubbornness even if on the other part of the city I have still decided to live In Hollywood the meeting with the Egyptian Theater takes place almost by chance simply going to the cinema I immediately fell in love after a few months I was already voluntary and there that I emerged as a volunteer after a while Sara gets a place as a bartender also thanks to his commitment and dedicated hours To that magical place by snatching tickets and moving furniture for the free renovation at that time they were modernizing the projections to be able to host the film to the nitrate also needed someone with technical skills so I went on telling I was immediately noticed and in a short time I became assistant to the manager, but the job is not enough for o to end a visa so lost permission Sara must find an alternative I enrolled in a business course and a world opened up thanks to the school I could work in the cinema with a kind of internship paid, however, with a normal salary re -teenaged the visa always as Student Sara is again promoted to Facility Manager of cinema practically I was looking for problems and I solved them I reorganized the rooms I arranged what was to be fixed and after a few months I started helping also in the marketing department in short, I did and do a little bit of everything and I I like what I can do every day I rediscovered manager and I understood that I was born manager also read my life in London in the Machista of Finance but here the internships have been aimed at hiring for two and a half years Sara has come true his dream even if it specifies all to end up in December, the visa as a student expires because I finish the course my stay is linked to the permits to return is not in the plans the same work in Italy even if absurdly was paid 10 thousand euros a month would not have the same value for her in Italy there is always someone who knows more than you only because maybe you are young he tells here instead everyone can have a good idea by fully expressing their potential missing according to Sara is above all the possibility of growth that instead in the USA is certainly living in Los Angeles even if with a good salary greater than Italian standards, life is not simple, especially if you do anything else beyond work, an example for one evening at the cinema are spent at least $ 30, saying that in any case he would not return to Cesena I love what I love what I do here I would not do it for another place I certainly miss the tagliatelle of my aunt Laura but I try to eat and healthy
Imagine placing a tree to water it and take care of it for years to spend hundreds of thousands of euros so that it puts roots and bring fruit and then when the time comes to reap the fruits, cut it out or planted it in the vegetable garden of the neighbor who will eat all your apples The most serious problem is that the state spends 400 thousand euros for each of us explains Giovanni Mori of the Italian enhancement group of PhD V I Ph D is a system that still prepares well and then does not catch the fruits according to the skills strategy diagnostic report of the OECD in ours Country C is a very low prize for human capital means that the years of study does not correspond to adequate recognition neither on paper nor in the paycheck in poor words today there is no economic return in having achieved a doctorate laws also more and more Italian ISTATs they move abroad the 53 is D iPlomato or graduate for the first time the migrants from Africa falls 17, the V I PH D is a group born in May following the sentence of the Constitutional Court that rejected the requests of the research doctors on the equation between doctorate and qualification to school teaching today collects About 15 thousand people in Tutt Italia and has as its main objective the enhancement of the title of PHD in the school and in the public administration the English PhD acronym that stands for Philosophiae Doctor is the highest qualification in the Italian system aligned all over the world and receives the Minimum recognition a study path that lasts at least three years following the degree is led by a tutor is accessed with a public competition and which ends with a doctoral thesis according to the PhD student and research doctors ADI in 10 years The doctorate collapsed were 15832 from 2007 and 8960 last year decreasing of almost half 43 but therefore what is it for doing the doctorate in Italy in Italy leads too often to unemployment responds with bitterness Giovanni Mori only the 10 is integrated into university in a stable way those who manage to enter the universities almost always do it as a precarious with Contracts from the assignist or for individual contract teachings paid just over two thousand euros l year no surprise so that on the 20th of those who own this title decides to make luggage and try their luck foreign the brains on the run are mainly research doctors and foreign universities They are happy to be already a high -level personnel without having spent anything the other paradox explains Giovanni is the one linked to teaching the PhDs can enable future teachers in the TFA in the Pas and in the For24 courses with contracts of a few hundred euros per year but they are not considered in turn enabled to teach in primary and secondary schools And if the examiner of the Guidelines did not have a license, read full time work in Sweden and I am a single mother, I have two daughters and Italy is not a country for women in October on the sidelines of the presentation of the search for research in Montecitorio, Minister FioMonti had Explicitly referred to the doctors of research and the economic and social capital lost with the escape of the brains we had placed many hopes in Minister Fioramonti as he too brain and research doctor but until today we have not been able to contact him and we do not understand why The members of the Board of Directive Claudio Brancaleoni Silvia Crupano Sergio Martellucci and Serena Modena tell, however we will meet the secretary of the Undersecretary to the education of Cristofaro to present them our requests and our proposals for the enhancement of our title in the Scol where we can bring new and advanced skills recently Nicola Fratoianni Italian Left has proposed an amendment to the decree on the recruitment of the teachers in which the research doctors are asked to insert who have the 24cfu within the extraordinary competition The requests of the VIPD committee to politics are Clearly solve the paradox that does not allow us to teach and obtain access to a qualifying path and then the fact that for a 30 -hour or 200 hours university course as a contract teachers we are paid with a reimbursement of expenses of 800 euros maximum 2000 euros Annui the Committee sent a letter to the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella to denounce the exclusion from the school decree that had the Senate OK becoming Law Italy is a republic founded at work recites Article 1 of our Constitution, therefore we make an appeal to its sensitivity It reads in the text as a privileged guarantor of the C Osdicting to stop this unacceptable condition of discrimination that humiliates and offends thousands of Italian research doctors outside the walls of the University The PHD is a weight more than a merit is pure overexruction, the Oversacation is the technical term to indicate the refrain that many doctors feel Repeating at the talks is too qualified for this work to specialize in one field and working in another where the doctorate is useless is the phenomenon of the MISMATCH The misalignment of skills that is another way of throwing away 400 thousand euros comments Giovanni I am a doctor of research in musical anthropology and work in a museum where I don't even need the doctorate, in fact I almost had to pretend that I did not have it to get the place like the famous scene of the film I stop when I want a doctor to be hired by a petrol station for not to have studied betrayed by a term too forbit apologizes to the university u n youth error only that everything is true here

 Many colleagues from my generation have escaped from Italy because they saw in front of them only years of precariousness and fixed -term contracts in Finland this problem is not the state helps you and having a family and a career at the same time is possible Sara Protto was born and grew up in a village of Monferrato Capriata d Orba and if I think about the times when he studied at the Faculty of Medicine of Pavia he has no doubts I was a nerd when he left Italy was 24 years old was fresh with a degree with an unforgettable experience behind the fifth Year of medicine I had made the Erasmus to Tampere changed my life to the office also in the office in Basel no infinite times in Sicily after the diploma I felt without hope or future today is 37 and his serenity found it in the city in which the Erasmus did where he specialized and the I vore as an interventionist radiologist to live in tampere allows me not to worry about anything I feel protected by the Finnish state and this allows me to focus on the family and work La Finland of Sara is a country in which school and university are free the well -organized kindergartens and a Limited cost The activities designed ad hoc for children and families but the most radical difference lies in the relationship of citizens with state entities and bureaucracy sometimes it seems to me that in Italy people must defend themselves from the state that there is no climate of respect and trust Many of my friends towards the public apparatuses feel threatened by the institutions here the level of protection is very high to have a family and a career at the same time is possible and I think this says much is not just a citizen a citizen in Finland is assisted for All the needs that have to do with his life as a parent and professional if for example my fig Lio is badly my superior sends a babysitter for free so that I can go to the hospital if I prefer to stay at home to take care of it too is possible without big problems, read also profs in Bristol my turn an advertising billboard in Italy say politicians say First the Italians here before the best to stay in the country where Sara was born he thought about it but then he decided to leave contributing it without knowing him to the emptiness of specialists in our hospitals will miss about 16 500 in 2025 and according to her there are some Explanations for these numbers one of the reasons why in Italy doctors are scarce is that for years there has been room only in the old generations and it has not been affected enough in young people Italian healthcare is one of the best in Europe but the resources have often been used in a unmealing way for not pe RDDDO Future White Camges These resources should be invested in salary career possibility of life quality of life it is not possible that a professional who graduated and specialized after years of labors must be satisfied with a scholarship at 30 years without being able to afford even an extra mortgage Our system was not at least before I left the meritocratic Italy and therefore did not encourage the people who had committed themselves for years to remain read they are also in Switzerland because in Italy I sent CV but I did not receive response in Finland things are different here there is no nepotism here Or almost being a woman is not a disadvantage from a professional point of view and the working hours are very precise you work but there is the time to go and get the children at the kindergarten or even have a hobby certainly she too has made the apprenticeship and before landing where s Perava in Tampere changed several Finnish hospitals working as a general practitioner and as a radiologist but his efforts were still balanced when I attended Italian hospitals as a student I noticed that medical colleagues were often forced to inhuman times and I hope things changed if they compared Finland to Italy does not know how to choose but after a while it naturally realizes a perfect place to live and Italy is beautiful, people are solar and kind but if it were not for the family and for the climate I would not think about it
 In Italy it does not trust young people, it is not given in research and even in general the skills and social lift is not rewarded, it is more motionless it seems to me that the solidarity between women is not widespread Marta Paterlini 50 years of scientific journalist and senior scientist at Karolinska Institute of Stockholm speaks so after having traveled half a convinced Europeanist world he left Italy 22 years ago when he decided to end up at the University of Cambridge a doctorate in neuroscience that he had started at the Faculty of Medicine of Brescia I have no grudge for Italy and I am convinced That the Italian educational system is of the highest level but many professions from the teacher to the doctor have been debased and my short experience made me understand that I would never have been able to survive in the Italian university environment because it was necessary to adapt to the mood of the baron on duty also readProf in Glasgow here you focus on positive things not

point of view here I have access to know -how technologies and exceptional services Sweden is one of the countries that invest most In research and in my sector it is a leading nation in Europe together with the United Kingdom but the difference with Italy can also be seen in bureaucracy if we look at maternity and paternity, welfare is very generous willing asiles and with proportionate costs compared to the salary doctors and dentists for free For minors free school both public and private the state assigns a bonus for each child who And after the age of 16, he passes directly to the teenager for how Marta describes Sweden is the paradise for children but in reality it seems to be also for parents especially for those like her divorced I believe that in any other place in the world could I work full time In the academy so serenely as a single mum everything I can do so safely from home read even neurosurgeon to Sydney here I met young profs who in Italy would have made life holders for life for life where he lived was an important piece of his life to Cambridge wrote a book in New York had a girl in Stockholm the second Italy remains home I did not escape and a part of me would come back tomorrow then I look at my two daughters and I think reluctantly that Italy is not a country for young people and Not for young women Sweden instead is maternalit For example, for example it is not a blackmail or an obstacle to his career, the family is seen by everyone as a wealth for the country, the announcement of a pregnancy is always welcomed with positivity is one of the most advanced countries from the point of view of gender equality and when We agree to fix a meeting it is normal to choose now and given on the basis of the commitments of those who are a parent

live in the suburbs and high -level professional roles are still exquisitely Swedish at the top where you make decisions, the non -Swedish have little access five years in New York they served them to understand that in this sense instead instead The United States are open and that a of Fferenza of Sweden for the apical roles is not made a difference between clubs and foreigners traveling then learned what it means to be European, the people take for granted too many civil and social achievements that Europe has reached after two world wars in recent years I have felt a lot European and

medium family of Stockholm does not have the car and it is needed to go out of town rents the trains instead work better in Italy being immersed in nature is part of the spirit of the Swedish and also for this reason the industries are much ahead in innovation Ecological despite the nostalgia of the affections Marta does not have many doubts I love Italy says but professionally at this point I think it is impossible to return to the fact that even abroad, comfort is an awareness in Italy C and what I call the added value a sort of human warmth that does not exist elsewhere and a message for

Parties looking for a job, the emigrants also exist in Italy go to the north of the country towards Europe towards America leave the family as in the early twentieth century with an ideal cardboard suitcase here are some of their stories told in Valigiandicartone ilto Gail com I started In 2005 from the province of Messina because I could not find a dignified and paid job I tried everything but it was always the usual story to work like a dog and paid when the owner wanted I kept hard hoping and trusting friends but in the end I understood that I could never have kept my dignity make me a life and a family my land is beautiful but I understood that only exploitation and recommendation also applies to clean the toilets after 14 years since that day since I really had in hand My cardboard suitcase I would do the same choice to escape my family in Veneto has always helped me after graduating from Padova Lav gold in a town in the province of Treviso I think of the South as a pearl in the hands of unscrupulous pirates to be alone and far from everyone was hard for the first 5 years but my education the courage and the desire to win have helped me And they allowed me with the time to find my way not to compromise me has given me the smile and the security I want is power and luck helps the bold people Sicily is destined for bankruptcy in all sectors I am ashamed for them that They use and abuse honest Sicilians Maurizio
Out of 14 thousand workers who returned to Italy thanks to the tax incentives more than half have escaped again is the conclusion of a study by the counter -esodo group the most important Italian community for the return of the brain -fleeing brains that analyzed data from the Revenue Agency and the Ministry of I work in the period from 2011 to 2017, that is, the years following the entry into force of law 238 of 2010 which reduced the taxable up to 80 for repatriages, it is estimated that 14 thousand people have chosen to return to work in our country 7 033 of them are already Start for abroad, the incentives are one of the reasons that push the expats to return even if we know that they are not decisive but as they are disciplined at the moment they are not enough to retain them in Italy for a long time explains to Ilfattoquotidiano it Francesco Rossi one of the founders of the community yes deals with qualified workers accustomed to moving and who abroad can count on sti Slides on average much higher for this once the period of lower taxation is exhausted, it is easy that they give in the sirens of a new use abroad also read Migrantes in 2018 over 128 thousand Italians emigrated abroad in 13 years increased by 70 at birth in 2015 the counter -good group had about twenty scarce of people put together with word of mouth the purpose was in the short term convince the government to restore the tax incentives of law 238 2010 the counter -good law precisely an innovative provision thanks to which many of them had returned to live and produce Income in our country a

on the tax breaks applicable to their case a set of rules that has become very complex in recent years not only but the group also performs a function of representation by bringing to the institutions the voice of the daredevils who have decided to return or would like to do it but ask the state to encourage them or at least not to make him the most difficult life what we do as an amateur and voluntary title is to fill an institutional lack explaining to IlFattoquotidiano it Francesco Rossi 41 years one of the founders of counter -good consultant in the parabancario sector lived for 8 years in Dublin before returning to Italy in 2011 together with Michele Valentini 40 years returned from London in 2013 he holds the lines of the community acts as a spokesperson for the members and responds to their questions the rules s The incentives are a labyrinth it is difficult to understand something if you do not know them in depth would need a portal a tool that the state makes available to citizens to orient oneself but there is no one we think about it is something that we had not thought of doing at the beginning But we realized that situations were necessary are the most diverse c and who graduated abroad and received a job offer in Italy who has returned for a few years but evaluates to start again once the incentives have already made those who have already made a career Outside but he would like to return to stay close to the family, read 37 Italians also win the scholarships of the European Research Council but only 18 work in Italy alongside the

years from the restoration of the incentives provided for by the counter -exodus law to the removal of the adjustment requested by the State to change the tax regime by passing from the original one of 2010 to the one introduced in 2015 between various contradictions but there are many battles still to be won and the first explains Francesco playing on the budget law in the process of approval in the growth decree converted into law in June, the government accepted some of our suggestions by bringing the reduction of the taxable tax for repatriages from 50 to 70 even at 90 for those who go to live in the South moreover If you buy a home or a child is made, the period in which you are entitled to the benefit from five to ten years pity that all this is worth only for those who will move to Italy starting from 2020 leaving the others out and creating a sort of discrimination between Serie A and Serie B brains so you risk that once the there nque years of incentives hundreds of workers choose to leave the goal instead must be to remain prolonging the concessions in the presence of indicators of a will to settle here in the long term as are the purchase of a house or the birth of a child we worked on An amendment to ensure that already in the maneuver this disparity can be remedied already because according to the promoters of the group once the brains are returned to Italy, it is at least as important not to make them escape the measures for the retent, that is, the detention introduced by the growth of the growth They are fundamental but they must apply for everyone

 For many years I have accepted everything with all conditions in order to put some money in my pocket then here in Germany I discovered that someone was willing to invest in me and now I understood it better unemployed than without dignity Emanuele Caputo 37 years ago the computer technician In a large multinational at the gates of Munich comes from Naples where he tried without success to find a job in his own university field I did not find myself because my approach has always been practical so I attended two professional training courses one as a manager of Internet sites and another as a system technician when looking for work the desert everyone wanted previous experience of practiced did not talk about it and it is not better even when in 2011 he chooses to move to Milan I lived at my sister's house, making me as a seller of insurance packages o Energy supply contracts also door to door in the hope of Being able to express my real potential I came out with so much stress and little money in hand so at 31 years exhausted by the lack of opportunities leaves everything and gets on a train to Monaco, read even anesthetist in the USA l italy is no longer attractive for doctors here It is unthinkable that politics interferes with healthcare I had a German C1 diploma taken in Naples when I still did not imagine leaving, despite this, the beginning was very difficult the first six months I worked for an interim agency by carrying out any type of job from the garbage Up to the courier and the cleaning man I did not even have a stable accommodation for hostels then I found a job more suited to my inclinations to replace work stations on behalf of a large client company after a year and a half, however, Emanuele realizes that his Role does not allow him to grow but I was now 34 years old at that age it is difficult to change work in Italy I would have been out of market for anyone in Germany, however, there are special professional redevelopment schools promoted by the Federal Employment Agency I fired and I joined a program To obtain the diploma of IT systems supplement for two years, I followed the full -time courses with six months of internship to maintain myself I had the unemployment benefit but also a specific contribution for the payment of the rent for a total of over one thousand euros per month Read also in Switzerland because in Italy I sent CV but I did not receive an answer even before ending the courses tells had already received various offers I didn't need to search for head hunters found me on LinkedIn and Xing a widespread social network in Germany I have in Handed to work in my current company before obtaining the diploma, the salary is excellent a novice computer technician here can already receive 40 thousand euros gross l year net of any extras provided by the employer but it is not just money here c It is the awareness that a company works only if employees and employees work in turn work if they do not claim too much from them perhaps I was lucky but I do not seem true to earn a living finally with what I can do without consuming myself in exhausting jobs or Feeling the pressure to close as much contracts as possible, as regards the temporary work, there is no difference was a physical and psychological massacre just as in Italy I also read the engineer in Zurich in Italy, research checks were a prize for my ideas but the merits they took them others Emanuele in Germany has found its dimension so much so that it is thinking of asking for double citizenship one of the major Italian limits is the absence of culture of professional training here after superiors there is a program for approaching Ausbible work that has the same dignity as university studies I cannot help but get angry towards a country that gives little value to merit to competence and talent by forcing many young people to emigrate where instead the qualified workforce is required, we speak so much of digitization but then we do not invest at all in training and use of computer scientists are privileged Much cheaper and more easily blackmailed workers for this at least for now I do not consider the idea of ??returning I would return only to the same conditions that I have here in terms of salary environment and quality of life I don't see it possible at least not now but if things do not they change more and more they will go ol Three boundaries to keep us away from lack of unemployment prospects or worse still by the humiliation of working and being poor as it happened to me for a long time in the end I chose the dignity Twitter Paolofrosina
 Italy is not attractive for doctors is a country that to make up for their lack thinks of taking on recent graduates without specialization and of keeping health personnel up to 70 years of age to speak is Luca the glue Italian anesthesiologist who works in the USA today and that denounced with an open letter in the scientific magazine The Lancet l inadequacy of the strategies discussed in Italy to return the doctors to the lane while in the rest of the world the conditions are improved and the improvement programs such as the Italian Fellowships are started, we propose to lower the quality To increase the number of personnel to hire unwilling medical staff, the health system means looking for dequalified and low -cost work, even neurosurgeon reads to Sydney here I met young profs who would have done the glue holders in Italy the glue has 35 year I a medicine degree at San Raffaele in Milan and a specialization under anesthesia at the University of Parma could be one of the many anesthesiologists of our public hospitals but the white coat has decided to wear it in North Carolina where it is resident in Anesthesiology at Duke University in Durham I do not consider myself a brain on the run and I do not feel rancor towards Italy, on the contrary, I appreciate our national health system and its principles but today it has become anachronistic must be reformed and awarmed an aging that from its point of view begins with the wrong assumptions if you look at the Proposals of the Regions do not produce enough specialists and thousands of it from Italy every year is understandable here in the United States, for example, doctors are more valued and have not only a good salary but awards and contractual power can devote time to research beyond that at the clinic and almost always are at the forefront of And administrative decisions here then it is unthinkable that politics interferes with healthcare the hypothesis of bringing the medical retirement threshold to 70 years of taking non -specialized or even recruiting them from countries where the working conditions are more backward than our second Luca He also risks aggravating things my key to reading the problem is that our country exports more doctors of those who manage to care about it from abroad is on this that we must intervene in fact by being the estimates of the Fiao 2018 report only the 75 of the specialists formed He chooses to work for the National Health System Read also our life in Australia is without haste and in front of the ocean here we have lost the habit of worrying the rest ends like Luca in abroad hospitals where career possibilities and working conditions are p There are thousands of professionals who would like to work in Usa Canada France as never to come to work in Italy country full of culture and wonderful places so much so to begin with the conditions for young people to still want to do doctors in Italy We must improve the organization of the work says Luca increase state funding we allocate about 10 less than the other EU countries to focus on meritocracy for career advancement avoiding the positions for life and then increase the salaries on average equal to 17 euros now so that Our professionals do not escape the system should become more transparent you have to get the policy out of health to put an end to public competitions often made up and introduce direct hiring for interview read also seismologist in Irla NDA in Italy underpaid and with a metalworker contract here in Dublin at work I am happy hoping that it is enough according to the projections of the Anaoo Assomed union in 2025 will miss about 17 thousand specialist doctors in Italy we are really doing something to stop the bleeding probably not enough Luca for example He decided to pack his bags during the specialist when he left for a semester of research in the USA and glimpsed professional and scientific clinical possibilities that in Italy would have been a mirage on my return I thought of doing the qualification exams in the USA followed by A fellowship in America since Italian specialization is not recognized now I am about to finish the training in Duke anesthesia to be able to work in the USA without restrictions I would like to return to Italy my experience first, however, I hope that some reformer of large views will be able from change our health system and make it attractive
 In the South if you do not be born in a family with the right knowledge you will hardly make your way with this phrase in the head and a nice dose of resignation except Buttitta 35 years old Sicilian started for Switzerland I had touched the bottom I didn't see any hope anymore and no future for me He says so after the diploma Salvo leaves family and friends in Bagheria and goes to live in Basel where he works in a service company for architects and engineers today and is starting his startup here you have many possibilities despite the restrictive rules for foreigners who cannot Receiving a residence permit if they do not have a job you feel fully involved in the dynamics of the country except, however, still remembers his first day in Switzerland a shock was February 9, 2009, he remembers Basel was packed with snow and was very cold for a young Sicilian this is A trauma that can mark life remembers with a smile for a week except remains closed in House when it comes out he covers himself as an Eschimese continuing to repeat himself but I really want to live here also read neurosurgeon to Sydney here I met young profs who would have made life -for -life holders in Italy graduated in business economics in Lugano and specialized in digital marketing little After you find work in Switzerland tells you can breathe the air of the multiculturality of tolerance and respect the tax burden is very low, the salaries are adequate for the cost of living and banks and infrastructures clearly better than the Italian ones in the office then you are not forced to schedule Infiniti continues at 6 pm I am free every day and so I can dedicate myself to friends or activities of the Italian community where I am particularly involved, the costs are clearly higher than the other European countries but with the right AC Courtesy can be afforded with a lifestyle ahead and higher than the average the greatest difficulty for a Sicilian in Switzerland is not the cold or lack of the sea smiles but the German is not easy to learn it and this is a very limiting aspect of other singing The strong presence of the Italian community and above all of many young people compensated almost all to date my best friends I met them here in Switzerland and with them I am experiencing this adventure read also engineer in Zurich in Italy. Research checks were a prize for mine Ideas but the merits took them other Salvo is considered a small ambassador of Italian culture abroad are always engaged in a thousand activities for the Italian community in Switzerland there are many compatriots here with different lives and cultures all all united by the same desire for redemption And thanks to the experience of these years, he looks to the future with great optimism does not know if he will remain for life in Switzerland but one thing is certain today I have a different vision wider horizons for me the world is at hand each country is more Close and brings with it new challenges to be gathered at this moment Salvo is moving on two fronts on the one hand, it carries on a business project linked to the world of startups and innovative SMEs on the other is undertaking to become the spokesperson for the needs of the emigrated compatriots In the next few years I want to bring to Italy everything I learned and that I have collected and spending my experience for my country to give a future to the many young people who have not stopped dreaming today, we are also in London because Italy is Fossilized here the services work and we seem to have the world in your pocket i The relationship with Italy continues to be ambivalent unless he believes that no one should be born and die in the same country and for him being emigrant is a lifestyle with a condemnation is the right of all men being free to leave their land to seek their own Size elsewhere what young Italians have to do is not to give up not let the others choose your future nobody can take away the freedom to dream insists from a clear concept we guys we only have to be ready to get out of our comfort zone break down The walls of the prejudice and leave we have the best universities of Europe the best minds but Italy is strongly delayed compared to other countries and cannot hold back its young people who continue to escape abroad
A career as a neuroscientist built by crossing three continents from Naples to Canada passing through Austria and Germany Professor Antonio of Ieva neurosurgery and university professor today lives and works at Sydney Australia but would never define himself as a brain on the run, fortunately I have never had to run away from anything And from nobody I embarked on all my experiences with the fixed idea of ??gaining improve and growing in the most suitable place often giving up with excellent positions to continue studying and forming me I like a phrase that I read we are not trees his path started to Second University of Naples was a student in Medicine and Surgery at the Caserta headquarters, the third year he spends him in Bonn in Erasmus The experience in Germany useless to say it was probably the most educational of my life concluded his studies at Federico II preparing part of the thesis Degree in Vienna and immediately afterwards it was for a period in Phi Ladelphia willing to undertake the specialization then for several reasons including the excessive costs of the USA I then decided to specialize in Milan and Brescia while working started a doctorate in Vienna two years after the jump in Canada where he was hyper specialized in cerebral tumors And of the cranial base he recalls that he heard about Toronto as an Italian province without Italian politics for the large number of compatriots after three years a job offer as academic neurosurgeon led him to Sydney where he has now lived here I have been working here and I founded and directing a computational neurosurgery laboratory and artificial intelligence that I managed to open thanks to research funds that I won explains proud but the choice to leave Vienna was not at all obvious I was now talking well the German I was already a professor and I had been offered to direct the neuroanatomy laboratory for which I was between Winned there, on the other hand, I left for a further training experience in Toronto, starting again from zero 1 4 The push starting says is something innate for desire to improve by cosmopolitan spirit but also for practical reasons one of the professional advantages of working abroad is the balance between surgical activity and academic research two aspects that in our hospitals still struggle to reconcile this balance is still an utopia in Italy or at least it was when I started I know that the situation is finally m Byrely, but this was my personal motivation for the choice to live and work abroad with all the sacrifices that IEVA Professor entails is an academic neurosurgeon definition that in itself does not yet mean very much explain in my personal experience I saw too many University barons in many countries abroad, the academic surgeon carries out an incredible surgical experience but it is also part of the academic world makes research and shares its knowledge some systems guarantee the time protected to surgeons to also devote themselves to research and teaching activity not as if it were A hobby The research activity led him to write two academic books in English to which this year he added a popularist in Italian with an ecological soul the compendium of biology for infants whose proceeds will be entirely donated to the The Ocean Cleanup Foundation that yes Take care of cleaning the oceans of plastic Read also in Switzerland because in Italy I sent CV but I did not receive an answer often tells he is contacted by those who are thinking of leaving people ask him for generic information on salary rentals hours of work acquaintances are now quick enough to select those who ask for so much but they will not do Nothing among Italian friends abroad, we defined it, the selection at the border reflects on the definition of brains on the run and on the representation that makes it in the newspapers and debates in fact people who go abroad for fashion there are doctors who go to do little more than what they would have done in Italy and then returning to the curriculum of foreign experience as if they were their professional consecration but underlines there are also people and several also that abroad finally manage to do that that they would never have managed to do in Italy I met many young university professors who in Italy would have made the life holders for researchers who work for their ideas avoiding the precarious or excessive university hierarchy and hospital according to the professor the brains on the run exist but there There are also hands and dreams on the run now the definition evokes a too generic concept ironed here and there to cover many different situations and the choice of words is not the happiest the concept of escape evokes a crime or a escapade from An unsustainable or dangerous situation in truth for these people the escape is nient other than a search for things not found or new training experiences better the English definition Brain Drain brains that flow the flow of brains regardless of the borders is a positive phenomenon both for The society that for science becomes a problem when it is a To be in balance, it must become attractive for brains as it is for tourists as during the Renaissance on the prospect of returning to Italy of Ieva joke my mother will read the article so I should probably say yes and then adds who remains in Italy is neither a coward nor a failed but not even a hero someone who has had the need for the skill or luck of being able to do what they want in their own country the important thing is that everyone finds their own balance and happiness
Tens of thousands of Italians who continue to emigrate abroad by marking a clear impoverishment of the South Regions increasingly depopulated the annual report on Italians abroad of the Migrantes Foundation which re -elaborates the Aire and Istat data notes that in 2018 over 128 thousand expats were With a difference compared to the previous year of 400 units and over 5 2 million compatriots are enrolled in the registry of foreign residents but the phenomenon of Italian emigration is better understood by observing the long period in the last 13 years from 2006 to 2019 the number of whom It goes away, it increased by 70 2 percent and the AIR members have been passed by just over 3 1 million to the current 5 288 281 and almost half 48 9 percent started from the South more precisely from January to December 2018 in the register of the Italian registry abroad, 242 353 Italians enrolled, of which 53 1 for expatriation on 35 9 per birth on 6 8 for re -registration From unavailability on 3 3 for the acquisition of citizenship and approximately 0 9 for transfer from the aire of another municipality is confirmed by the prevalence of men over 71 thousand on 55 2 on women over 57 thousand on 44 8 a difference that in the last year has slightly Acclaimed are above all celibates and unmarried 64 0 and after married and 30 3 in the last 13 years from 2006 to 2019, the AIR members have passed from just over 3 1 million to the current 5 288 281 and almost half 48 9 per Cento started from the South precisely on the south, the report lights an extra lighthouse by reporting the inexhaustible impoverishment of the South if in the years following the second post -war period the dossier explains the migratory flows to the centrotered regions were mainly consisting of labor from the rural areas of the South in the last decade on average the 70 of migrations from the southern and insular regions to the center north The stories of those who emigrate according to what emerges are often characterized by projects that are not well defined with situations that change at speeds that are unthinkable for the most disparate reasons the birth of a child the arrival of a health problem has been characterized by a high level of medium tall education A career promotion a job opportunity no longer applies the strategy of forever, mobility can have different reasons always explains the dossier but that of the escape of young people and professionals from Italy should be more circular is a phenomenon on which the Minister of Education also Lorenzo Fioramonti already brain on the run in South Africa launched the alarm underlining that the departure of each graduate coincides with the loss of 250 thousand euros of our taxes and also for the president of the Chamber Fico the bleeding of young people who decide to build their future outside the Italy puts the future of the country at risk
How long is it for an Italian graduate to take the first step in the British school system to become a teacher twenty -five minutes or so it happened to Antonio Moraca Professor of Latin and Italian who has lived and works in Bristol for 5 years in the United Kingdom I am not saying that it is I was easy to tell I had to study for the entrance test attending the course for the qualification for ten months to make the interview the interviews but from a bureaucratic point of view it was all extremely simple and I could count on the government scholarships for the expenses and the Maintenance also laws in London in Italy in Italy offered me an indeterminate from a thousand euros per month here Guido a team of 20 people Antonio graduated with honors from Federico II of Naples in modern philology and decides to leave for an abroad experience arrives in Bristol With the hope d The being able to land in the United States for a doctorate I don't think there is a need to list all the reasons why I didn't want to do research in Italy it was worth spending some time in Bristol to perfect the language while I was waiting for a response from the USA for a Period is maintained by working in a chain of sushi restaurants, the doctorate does not go through and Antonio decides to devote himself to teaching between a waiter and the other explores the site of the Italian Ministry of Education to understand how to become a professor, I barbed myself between a bureaucratic process and the other to understand which class of competition to access what documentation to present stamp duty pec c were many things to consider better to start as a professor of support and accumulate middle school or high school score in which region but above all I wondered where I find them the money to pay The active training internship read an that in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy what is missing in Italy and a country that looks to the future the turning point comes by chance from the window of a bus Antonio is returning home when a billboard is noticed on the street for the billboards that Starts Get Int Teaching Your First Step Towards An Amazing and Fullfilling Career enters the teaching the first step towards an extraordinary career The spot was on the billboards and circulated also on television I didn't have to look for much to say that they found me I was suffering a short search With the smartphone they postponed me to the government website where there was a section dedicated to qualification to teaching a video explained step by step how to fill in the question to be sent to three universities or with a free email I had made my first step towards a career from Time teacher took twenty -five minutes Two weeks after the University of West of England, he summons him for an interview and an aptitude test for the teaching of Italian and French The test to be addressed is arduous but not impossible once passed to Antonio is offered a place to obtain the qualification for teaching the Interesting is that the government offered scholarships that came up to 20 thousand pounds for those who had graduated with the highest votes explains money that would have served the candidates to pay the transport and sustenance travel costs to reach the schools where it would be Once the internship has been carried out to follow the lessons to the University and keep during the course that lasted from September to June in addition, a loan of 9 thousand pounds could be requested to be returned to very small installments only if you get a chair and with a salary not less than 21 500 pounds l year with which to pay the costs of the course accustomed to the system Italian such a linear path seems to be a mirage now with Brexit getting scholarships is more difficult I have an employment contract so I don't worry about the future but the main change that we all hear is the change of value of the pound when I arrived It was worth 1 euro and 45 now 1 12 or down from there I am also in Switzerland because in Italy I sent CV but I did not receive an answer now Antonio teaches Italian and Latin to boys from 11 to 18 years the thing I would like to emphasize is that I came to Bristol for the first time in February 2014 in September 2015 I signed an indefinite contract the comparison with the Italian system it is inevitable to enter the Italian system is so complicated that I do not wish anyone competitions on competitions supplementary exams scrolls without knowing what corner to what corner of the country you will end up in Veneto or i N here the schools publish the places that get rid of each year as each professor can control them and send a candidacy for those who consider interesting by accompanying it with two reference letters tells the difference between the two systems even in daily practice we are observed there are Results and objectives that we must achieve and when I say we intend all British and not the teachers are also warmly invited to attend at least once a year a refresher course at the expense of the school, my increase in salary in part also depends on the results of mine classes in Italy the unions would never allow such a thing but when I was in superiors I would have wanted someone to check how the professors did their job read we are also in London because Italy is fossilized here the services work And we seem to have the world in his pocket Antonio testifies to the great presence of Italians in the institutes of overseas especially in the research laboratories sometimes from how many compatriots I see in the British universities I think that research in England stands on the shoulders of Italians is obviously a hyperbole But they are many I was in Corovoglia a few days ago with friends and a PhD student of Sheffield told me that in his department they are almost all Italian and it is understandable because the money spent outside for the research is really many com it is right that it is if you want remain always updated and competitive in Italy, politicians always say the Italians first here are taken for granted first the best
Many Italians give skills abroad because they are forced to leave it from Italy a phenomenon that also has an economic and not only social impact on the whole country system the Minister of Education Lorenzo Fioramonti interviewed by IlFattoquotidiano It when he was still brain on the run in South Africa speaks of the growing growing Wave of compatriots who decide to leave the brain escape said on the sidelines of the presentation of the research pact is a fundamental theme is the real migratory emergency every time a graduate leaves our country explains Fioramonti are 250 thousand euros that are leaving ours and your taxes if a person makes a doctorate 300 thousand euros we are losing millions of euros through a brain escape that we have formed with our resources the flow of young people who leave Italy has added is a fundamental theme and not only because it is an embarrassment for the country and speaks to you one who lived great part of one's adult life and all its academic career abroad and that no longer wants to be embarrassed when the boundaries of our country crosses in being welcomed by other nations that today are strong of our skills that we have given to him see also maneuver the Minister FioMonti Resources for school university and research seem to be few I am worried according to the 2018 data of the Migrantes Report in 2017 243 thousand Italians started on 3 more than in 2016 and the 37 48 thousand people had between 18 and 34 years of age the Italians among the 35 and 49 years old are a quarter of the total of just over 32 thousand people but the most important growths are noticed from 50 years up +20 7 in the age class 50 64 +35 3 in the 65 74 year old +49 8 in that 75 84 years and +78 6 from 85 years up to 1000 elderly all data concerning emigration And in other countries but there are also many compatriots who decide to move from South to Northern Italy the Svimez report speaks of two million people in the last 15 years in particular of young people and qualified workers Sicily is one of the regions most affected by the theme depopulation on which the movement of the cardboard suitcases born in Palermo from Father Antonio Garau insists who will parade in Palermo together with the unions for the unions so that the institutions listen to the alarm cry of the many young people who do not find work and who are for this forced to go away from their own city
A curriculum full of international experiences Harvard Tokyo Chicago sent more than sixty times never any response and then paradoxically I ended up working in a large Italian group but from Switzerland Antonio Alderuccio 29 years old is originally from Alto Reno Terme in the province of Bologna and now lives to Basel where he had moved following his partner to look for work in a short time found work in the legal team of a company in the energy sector an indefinite contract that allowed Antonio to plan the wedding and to bear the daily expenses of the Father for four years sick of Alzheimer, read also engineer in London in Italy they offered me an indeterminate from a thousand euros per month here I drive a team of 20 people graduated in law in Bologna during his studies a scientific journal in English univ Ersity of Bologna Law Review despite the skepticism of some professors and the indifference of the institutions to which he had turned to talk about a well -started project with scientific contributions from all over the world and indexed in the main international databases the lack of dialogue with the institutions is demeaning mi Meanwhile, his CV has been very bitterly enriched with international experiences three months in Harvard to prepare the degree thesis a Summer School in London and one in Tokyo after graduation deepens his studies in Chicago I have to thank the loans of the grandparents and the sacrifices of my parents But it is an investment that I would redo more hundred times, also read in Japan in Italy unemployment without end here there is love for the community and respect for the rules in the meantime makes the bones with several internships in Bologna Milan and Shanghai but the expert In law firms pushes him to change the course that I was a staggered pre -graduate I always returned home late in the evening the practitioners made a decidedly worse life often worked even the weekend but it was above all the human side that scared myself looked at the older colleagues and I thought I was So I don't want to become Antonio therefore thinks of orienting himself on research with a doctorate in the United Kingdom but at that time the father's illness arrives with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's to face and the expenses that derive from it for the care and domestic maintenance realizes having to look for work soon send curricula to Milan Bologna and Florence but the answers are slow to arrive were not candidates thrown at randomly I structured the presentation letters so that they were adhering to the needs of the companies I sent almost 65 applications in two years and they called me for One interview his girlfriend Eleonora Lena lives a similar experience one I degree a master's degree and several internships in the context of international relations in order to be independent while looking for work in its sector for some time I work as a waitress in a pizzeria in Mantua I have always believed in the dignity of the job any job comments Eleonora taught me my mother who Today there is no longer when he arrived in Italy from India he always rolled up his sleeves and did any job with humility and determination and had graduated after months of unsuccessful research and dozen of CV Eleonora responds to an announcement of a consultancy company in Pharmaceutical context in Switzerland four days later is called back for an interview via Skype follows the offer of a paid internship that in a few months becomes a stable work Antonio after a year decides to reach it in Basel where he finds work after a while we never thought to escape from Italy or that abroad was better we have simply ampliat or the research radius and Switzerland replied laws also in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy what is missing in Italy and a country that looks to the future a difficult decision to take but many people criticize the choice of leaving leaving a sick father but I turn the question as we would have done to support his illness if I had been home on the sofa with my salary I can provide my father's medical assistance giving my mother a little economic tranquility just dad in the His moments of lucidity prompted me to move to me now Antonio works in the legal office of a Swiss company and has started a doctorate at the University of Freiburg the company for which I work part of an Italian group and to enter it I had to expatriate it is almost a paradox the cost of living in Switizz It is generally higher but the scissor supports is more balanced we have many additional expenses but we have a beautiful house the much desired electric machine we can go out for dinner and go on vacation also putting something in Italy aside in the same job position we would hardly have been able to have This tenor of life the thing that makes them proud to tell it is to organize their marriage without having to ask anything from the families Antonio has never regretted his choice I don't know if we are brains on the run we are a couple of Italians who works a little hurts there Idea of ??contributing to a country that is not ours we would have liked to stay in Italy we tried we did not succeed with a pinch of bitterness and then adds my mom often tells me badly bad that you went away and you settled otherwise as we would have I think I am lucky but the thought puts me anxious how many guys in Italy there are in my situation or worse

 I do not believe in the myth of abroad I think that making me come where I am now my form mentis nobody outside Italy guarantees you to break through Alberto Semini is 29 years old is an aerospace engineer and since 2015 he lives around the world passing through Australia And France in November 2017 landed in London today only four years after the master's degree, he led an international team of 20 people as a project manager managing budgets of a few million euros a goal says that I would never have reached in Italy in such a short time in the 2009 Alberto enrolled in the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering in Bologna based in Forl I had a great passion for the engineering world even if as a child I wanted to dream of being a writer telling the Alberto of Modenese origin after the three -year title therefore decides to continue his magistral studies At the Polytechnic of Turin one of the most effective faculties of the sector here I had the Possibility to leave for the first time explains in 2015 I won a seven and a half months scholarship in Australia to write the thesis and I received the first offer a doctorate of research La vita from the other part of the world, however it is not always simple e Above all, in Alberto there is Europe so he decides to return home and after graduating to start looking for work as a master's graduate with full marks he does some interviews in Italy but no offer was at the height of that received by the French company for which after which Having overcome four selections works all today and think that they found me through the Polytechnic website tells Alberto explaining that foreign companies often recruit even so simply by looking at the most prestigious universities website for the sector of competence

they immediately offered me an indeterminate more or less around one thousand euros per month promised shots of seniority but I never explored the possibility because shortly afterwards he called me the multinational for which I still work for an opportunity on the Italian Riviera still tells Alberto Explaining that the differences from the beginning have been many admitted that I have never worked in Italy he still says but after having lived in four Italian countries including I can say that the differences are there, the career of the then 26 year old in fact began in 2016 in the Sophia headquarters Pololis in the province of Nice as a pure engineer but after only six months they promoted me to Project Manager and then after a year and seven months in November 2017 I had the opportunity to move to London where I follow my passion, that is, technical projects in the aeronautical field and precisely the evaluation of the skills with the relative possibility of growth is que The one who is missing in Italy according to Alberto not to mention the wage gap adds not everything, however, depends on what is missing in Italy because to count so much is the form mentis with which you approach abroad in Italy I probably would never have had the responsibilities that I have now He explains but who has never been abroad who believes that leaving it is equivalent to breaking through the fact that he is successful depends on the company and above all I know Italians who have been here for ten years but always remain in the same position certain the Italy is more firm and there is A different evaluation of seniority but it does not only depend on that to leave in any case it was not easy I miss the culture and my family but I work in an international environment and I notice that all this also applies to other colleagues tells Alberto on lunch break goes Often with people of the same nationality of course the quality of life is different but I am not on the run from my PA I also perform the same salary, however Alberto would not return because his work allows him to travel and open up to different cultures after so many years away from home I feel enriched I think that the journey is a fundamental condition to develop this learning process even if for However, opening up to the world is needed a certain predisposition, it is demonstrated by the fact that I guide a team of people from different countries of the world and I am the glue that must make everyone communicate
At 16 Federica Marchesini made her first cultural exchange in Nmes in the south of France there I decided that I didn't want to go home again tells a year in London just finished the superiors three in Hamburg then South Africa I understood immediately how much I liked to live Out of Italy and now I can say that I have spent more years of my life abroad that in my country Federica is today 46 years old is a teacher and lives from 18 to Cape Town I have always had more interest in other countries I felt very limiting Verona He says remembering when he has been close to his reality as a teenager so after England and Germany has arrived in the South African capital finds smiling people and South Africa is a welcoming and friendly country continues the Veronese teacher affected by the affection that surrounded him in the African country where Italians are generally well seen our country is considered a tourist destination to visit At least once in a lifetime he tells Federica speaks 5 languages ??currently and has opened a school that personally manages lessons in person or on Skype all over the world teaching Italian French over more organizes social and cultural events to bring together and animate the Italian local community Speaking of the city cities, the differences with Italy are many for sure life is less expensive than Italy but there is more crime because social differences especially from an economic point of view are still strong and in the early days it was difficult to get used to being always On alert the strong points are the open spaces, nature and animals even if after dinner there is no walk in the square South Africa for Federica is a multi -ethnic complex radiant country that also gave them unforgettable memories one above all when one day opening the mailbox has found its new South African identity card inside a This important document sent by ordinary mail incredible smiles and what has affected it in all the countries where he lived is the bureaucracy in Italy is alarming to forward any type of request I don't know if mine was a lucky case but in the countries where I have lived the practices were fast and efficient I would never have managed to open my private school so easily in Verona, read also in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy what is missing in Italy and a country that looks to the future Federica with Some of his students who suggests the Veronese teacher is that abroad there are more job opportunities I do not know the latest statistics but it is what my experience says if it were not like that there would be no continuous flow of departures from our country wherever he has lived I noticed that L Most of the Italians who have arrived have found work in Italy Federica prefers to go back on vacation recognizes that he has immense and invaluable heritage even if not quite valued but he says I don't know if I would live there you really complain about everything has become almost a syndrome The emotion felt is that common to many expat stories far from your country is as if seeing it from here from 12 thousand kilometers away I try more tolerance and affection if you return it is not in the plans it is not even to stay in South Africa this country is going through a Difficult moment on all fronts explains an air of uncertainty and a lot of confidence has been lost towards the state if it would go away would consider Europe as destination but Italy is not and to be sincere a more than Italian emigrant has never been heard I feel like a town in the world
 One after the other I saw exceptional colleagues to throw the sponge to flee abroad or to put themselves at the service of private individuals I have put it all to stay in Italy but in hindsight they had seen them longer Carmela de Marco 39 years old from mirror 4 thousand Inhabitants in the deep Salento is a researcher in the micro -bodic all Eth Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule the Federal Polytechnic of Zurich one of the major research institutes in the world The curriculum speaks for itself with a degree with praise in biomedical engineering doctorate in nanotechnology dozens of first signature publications in the most scientific journals prestigious yet at the Polytechnic of Milan it passed from one research allowance to the other without hope of obtaining a place from structured I collected five of them tells one for each year from 2009 to 2014 compensation variable between 1 200 and 1 500 euros per month the renewal of the check was the prize for my good ideas but the merits take them or the others if you do not have an indefinite contract the search projects you cannot sign them in the meantime I correctly corrected packs of homework I followed the thesis I organized the professor's agenda it was like being in a swamp where instead of evolving I felt I felt regressing every day not Only but many years of academic training made Carmela unplapped also for companies at interviews made me understand that I was too much that my knowledge would be wasted explains a curriculum like my frightening employers especially because they feared they had to pay more than other laws Our life in Australia is also without haste and in front of the ocean here we have lost the habit of worrying the turning point arrives when entering the sixth year as a assignist the last allowed by the law the roads at that point are two to give up or go to the example Tero like so many others before her but if I had to leave I wanted it to be worth it, I remember Carmela so I decided to try to win a European funding with a project that I had in mind for a while a microfluidic system with magnetic valves printed in 3D the announcement The Marie Curie is among the most competitive in the world thousands of ideas in the race less than 5 of which they manage to access the funds everyone told me that it was an impossible company and I myself have to say I did not have many hopes also to nominate the project I needed to An institution willing to support it I threw my heart beyond the obstacle and I wrote to Bradley Nelson of the Polytechnic of Zurich one of the world leaders of the micro -bikefish convinced that he would trash my email without even opening it appropriate and make it develop to some of his Nelson instead approves the idea and It encourages her to participate at the end of 2015 Carmela wins the financing the email in which they communicated to me the outcome that already contained my future contract was over in the spam tells in May 2016 at 36 years old the scientist leaves Milan for his new job in Switzerland Read Also veterinarian in Melbourne in Italy unacceptable conditions after graduating in many exploit young colleagues beyond the Alps finds an academic world that says it is not comparable to the Italian one starting from the most trivial aspects it will seem strange but I could not believe I have an office All for me with a latest generation PC provided by the University I tell in Milan I was used to working in the room with two or three other people using my laptop even the interpersonal relationship is all different in Italy even from post doc you are nothing more than a Estense one of your professors you work for them refer to them and they are the ones who decide if you go on or you are out of anything different from a tesseer or a doctoral and in fact often the figures confuse students do not see you as a reference but as one of them Equal the best almost like a competitor here instead my role is well defined and I am respected for what represents my figure, that is, a middle ground between a doctoral and a tenured teacher I can start independently projects and make use of the collaboration of the Students just like an extra professor I am a mistress of my time I don't have to answer anyone or take orders from the baron on duty certainly there are the moments of comparison in which I have to account for my work and my results but I know that I will be evaluated on the basis of those and not to other laws I also emigrated to Madagascar told me I was Crazy my future could not be in Milan and the other part says Carmela the meritocracy in Switzerland is not an empty concept I know doctorals who have not obtained the title because they had no adequate academic results says while in Italy we tend to learn all even those who cannot To do even three publications here then the research project is a serious thing the student processes it independently without suggestions or push by the profs and is assessed by an independent commission for this the title of PhD is preserves a certain prestige while in Italy is no longer worth nothing more Carmela has achieved one of the most important results of her career has developed a 4D indirect printing technique that allows you to produce medical and nanoscala medical tools that can be used for precision operations on fetuses or babies The first prototype consists in A micro stent a cylindrical structure Which serves to prevent occlusions of the blood vessels but the possible applications are infinite tells enthusiastic such as those in the context of targeted therapies with stem stamins or chemotherapy drugs to avoid their most promising systemic intake, however, it remains that of micro -tank for surgery applications I would like to go back to Italy one day and put what I know how to do my country admits but I don't think I will ever have the possibility I am nostalgia for many things first of the human relationship that here in Switzerland is much colder if I received An offer I would evaluate the Twitter Paolofrosina
 There was no reason to leave simply I love to travel better to say that they love to travel because six years ago Daniele Belloni did not start alone to make a one -way ticket from Cremona C was Beatrice Zanoni his partner is with her who lives today from the other Part of the world 15 thousand kilometers from home to Cairns in Queensland Australia a house on the Pacific Ocean for a couple of years has become their stable residence with their veranda to enjoy me with a nice glass of beer I and a good glass of wine She with the feet on the table Woe to call him brain on the run and woe to say that Daniele is an unhappy and angry boy with Italy we leave aside the stereotypes tells IlFattoquotidiano it I was certainly not tired of my country, however, he already knew that living like the Aussies In a beautiful place and without frenetic rhythms he would have liked a lot and so it was the life here is different I lost the habit of preoc Taking me for the difficulties that life puts you in front of you difficulties that there were for heaven's sake but that Beatrice and I have already forgotten nature has stolen his heart kilometers of beaches the coral reef and breathtaking views I also emigrated to Madagascar told me that I was crazy my future could not be in Milan everything started from here a little before by three words Working Holiday visa the visa lasting one year that allows you to spend a period of vacation and work in Australia kidnapped by the idea Daniele Vetraio in the Family and Beatrice Educator in a residence for the elderly then both 24 -year -olds with a great desire to challenge the world the summary of the first two years started is better than the Australia tour organized by a travel agency Sydney Oberon Eden Cooma Melbourne Kangaroo Island Adelaide Nullerb Or Plain Margaret River Perth to keep Daniele also in Australia is a window manual work the business card that allows him to live in a country always looking for capable craftsmen 1 5 The luck of knowing the profession thanks to my father gave me a huge advantage with pride with pride and works the ve Tro for niche customers for those who have the money so much to understand us instead is graphic designer for Beatrice as for Daniele staying to live in the land of the kangaroos was a choice of instinctive belly we won't waste time, let's say Bea reminds me when he presented himself The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa certified medical examination of English a few other documents and the visa was accepted we could afford a house of ours without being forced to divide it with other guys tell and all the difficulties are now behind difficulty that however do not hide Leaving the comfort zone at the beginning was hard I was a foreigner in a land that I still don't feel like my immigrant who had to prove humble and work hard but I never lived episodes of intolerance or marginalization I never felt in danger for our part there We are immediately integrated Read also committed in Japan in Italy unemploymentless unemployment here is love for the community and respect for the rules The classic question how you live in Australia annoys Daniele simply because it is a question that you cannot answer depends in fact which Australia we mean the metropolitan reality by Sydney Brisbane or Melbourne huge cities and frenetic beaches nightlife beaches a thousand opportunities the farms in the outback or the tablelands here your neighbor lives 30 kilometers from you Alice Springs lost in the desert halfway between Darwin and Adelaide both at 1500 kilometers away and Cairns where they live on their citizen on the coast where life goes to the right speed and it is simply perfect already perfect here is the right answer and in any case you think it summarizes Daniele l Australia was good with me perhaps because I lived it in the right direction Or maybe I was only lucky a six -year story that when I go back to Italy to visit my parents at the bar I like to tell this
 Yes I was forced to emigrate after losing my latest work in Italy for a year I looked for and done some interview but without results Giuseppe Bonfitto is 41 years old was born and studied in Rome a degree in oriental languages ??at Sapienza after being unemployed At 26 he decided to leave and move to Japan and live there for 15 years now with his family here you are too well and if you really want you can do a career tells laws also in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy this That is missing in Italy and a country that looks to the future the last job in Italy for Giuseppe was the salesman at a boutique at the Leonardo da Vinci airport in Fiumicino then after losing the place the nothing a year without work is long and exhausting especially a Psychological level recalls so it takes the idea in Consid Station and decides to move to Japan the first time I left Italy I was very afraid since I did not speak English or Japanese since then 15 years have passed away but because Japan has always been interested in the history of Japan since I was a child Feudale explains and still Studio Katori Shinto Ryu one of the oldest Japanese swords still existing The impact was traumatic the first time I arrived in Japan I was overwhelmed by the confusion by the noises by the multitude of people I did not know how to communicate and moreover The ATM did not work for me for a few days I ate using the few cash I had with me by choosing the cheapest sandwiches of the McDonald S also today Giuseppe is the salesman but in Yokohama to learn the language he employed no more than three years the quality of life it is better but his work day resembles that of one of his Italian counterparts with a D Ifferenza to take ten days of vacation l year I have to jump here we work here with a lot with no stop times explains Giuseppe wants to emphasize that the Japanese are hospitable but very severe at work from dishwasher to the manager you must be perfect when you are to yours workplace and nationality counts little at the same time, however, there will always be something that remains difficult to understand and that is the opposite compared to what was told by other expats I will never explain to me the manic fixation that always have to do extraordinary even if It is not needed, it also says Report Svimez 2 million emigrants from the South in 15 years farewell to young people and qualified workers from an economic point of view with a normal salary in Japan you live in a more than dignified confirmed way Giuseppe The State does not economically help foreigners here yes it is ug to the Japanese with the same obligations and the same rights an equality on life and paper that also translates into the absence of prejudices never felt on my skin explains Giuseppe follow their rules at work and in everyday life and there are not Problems The prospect of returning is more than far away even if Giuseppe would like to bring a little Italy from the other part of the world here unfortunately there is no real Italian community I asked the Italian Embassy of Tokyo several times if the creation of an Italian kindergarten was possible To give our children the opportunity to absorb some of the language and culture of our country the answer was clear there is no money and sponsor so nothing explains Giuseppe Esausto of the various no I created with other parents who had the same problems a group which organizes completely free events to make our customs live a little to the little ones the one you notice in jap It poses that the civic sense is shared and affects everyone's quality of life in Italy, it is thought too much to themselves, true love for the community here I learned that the union makes strength its relationship with Italy is of great affection Because it is the country that has seen me grow but also of hatred because it works well almost nothing and I notice every time I go back on vacation there is something that in Yokohama will never be there and that Giuseppe is missing the beauty of Rome Monuments He asked here is everywhere the same near each station you will always find the usual chain of fast food and bookstore bar but basically what weighs is the fact that he immediately found work after a year spent in nothing in Italy
 I am a seismologist in a country with almost zero seismicity while Italy periodically subject to earthquakes has excellent centers and very few funds Raffaele Bonadio defines himself as a radiologist of the Calabrian land of birth graduated in Pisa is concluding a doctorate in seismology in Dublin where he will also remain for the Post doc my Italian colleagues tell me about non -finished contracts abandoned searches for lack of baroni funds years ago I thought it was only a stereotype now I feel lucky read also in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy what is missing in Italy and A country that looks to the future after graduating in Physics at the University of Pisa Raffaele for a year I work in Milan, I had computer consultancy for a bank with me c had graduates in engineering or mathematics all with a metalworking contract It is not a joke we had signed a contract that provided to go to work in blue suit and helmet even if we obviously went in a jacket and tie it was truly underpaid I say it without rhetoric we were invited to work beyond the hours even if there was nothing to do just To show the customer that we did extraordinary, then he decides to return to Pisa for the specialist in geophysics concluded the master's degree we look around for the doctorate I sent hundreds of applications more than half in Italy I received answers from Germany Denmark united kingdom never from mine The country is the first to respond is a research institute in Geophysics in Dublin the search topic is interesting the good wages and then Raffaele thinks why not to make the interview tells the institute covered the travel expenses and the trip and so the doctorate begins In seismology at the Trinity College working at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies in the STE Sse Rooms where the Nobel Prize Prize Erwin Schrdinger prize remembered by high school students from all over the world for the cat paradox in the box 1 12 Dav Now that the doctorate is about to end, he received an offer for a post DOC was one of those offers that cannot be refused I accepted both for the economic benefits and for happiness in the workplace here I do what I like They would open themselves tells in Germany Portugal Australia United States Austria Holland also this time from her country I have not sought and I continue to look for open positions in Italy but I can't find it sorry Raffaele defines itself as an earth radiologist who observes what happens under the nostr The feet recently for example I was for three weeks at the mercy of the waves in the North Atlantic to place seismographs on the bottom of the ocean while we were there we did some educational projects we talked to streaming with the students of the Irish schools Raffaele also contacted a school near his Platania birthplace in the province of Catanzaro we explained our work and answered their questions does not know whether to really consider themselves a brain on the run I have never really had the opportunity to ask myself again or I have found work outside and I started and perhaps I will not have this Not even in the future, also veterinarian laws in Melbourne in Italy unacceptable conditions after graduation in many exploit young colleagues, irony says Raffaele is that he works as a seismologist in a country with seismicity almost zero here the earthquakes are meadows in order to notice in spite of this, Dublin has a very active institute, Italy which is a highly seismic land has centers of excellence but very few funds in 2016 with an international research team went to Amatrice when I was there to install the seismographs I perceived the difference in resources very strong The lack of funds can be seen from practical things, petrol to get on the spot the picks considered the high seismic risk of our country explains Raffaele we would have to invest more seismologists more we cannot predict earthquakes but research is fundamental for risk prevention Building adequately is essential to me the houses in Amatrice for each collapsed often the next next one had remained standing without cracks, I also emigrated to Madagascar, they told me that I was crazy my future could not be m Ilano Raffaele says he feels lucky especially when in international conferences he has the opportunity to meet his colleagues who remained in Italy some do not find funds to publish others work without being paid waiting for a contract that will come years ago I thought it was only a stereotype then reflects us and He adds I feel lucky but I realize that I am not doing anything special I am doing my job but I am sure I have a salary at the end of the month without the concerns that he had breathed in Italy the thought of not reaching the absence of meritocracy at the end of the month And the prevailing baronism if I think of the advantages of working here I do not think of only the economic conditions that also allow me to live in dignity and the current situation is the future that is much more rosy concludes you feel valued I know that it is often heard and It also sounds rhetorical but it is the truth and it is the most beautiful thing
 Since I left it from Italy I have been insulted in every way for having betrayed the homeland for taking my skills away I felt repeated that after all I had chosen the simplest way but leave is not at all easy for Marco Giulio Camurri 40 -year -old computer programmer and a great enthusiast of role -playing games The transfer was a jump in the dark where I left behind friends and relatives left Mantua in 2009 with a one -way ticket for London wanted to do what in Italy could not improve him his quality of life and find more satisfying methods of working out of the struggle for two euros more in the paycheck and crushed by the uncertainty not to get to the end of the month, read also in Albania I immediately found work here low taxes and little bureaucracy what is missing In Italy and a country that looks to the future Today he works as a programmer for a company that designs digital products and experiences for major brands and that treats it with velvet gloves salary excellent and not comparable to the Italian evenings at the pub with colleagues organized by the company itself once a month group trips In Europe once per year at the expense of the company to make Team Building in short, a company that takes care of employees and which is also growing in a few years, the employees have doubled by passing from 10 to 20 here he explains that they really put a lot of commitment In making us feel appreciated in creating social occasions and I must say this is one of the biggest differences that I found salaries aside from Italy where I have worked for six years as a programmer a IT sector where the salaries are much higher than in Italy too If here in London there is to deal with a much more important cost of living Many just think that the rent costs 1400 euros per month and the kindergarten for my son 1500 so my wife and I have to be careful not to overdo it with extra expenses but in any case we manage to go abroad holidays 4 or 5 times per year then then I would say that we do not suffer too much in London Marco also found love a Naturalized New Zealand Chinese girl together have had a child who is three years old and three New Zealand Italian passports today and also coming in English, read I am also an engineer and I tried to work in the South Italy but I had to escape if I returned I would starve London life is stimulating explains even if what is missing is the humanity that you breathe in a small town like Mantua even after 10 years in London and 7 in the house where I now live the feeling of belonging to this place is not the same that I try when P Assembly through the streets of Mantua and the unknowns are now all related to Brexit alive in London for ten years explains and this anti -European feeling I saw it was born families and friendships and it is preferred not to talk about it during parties and Christmas dinners but on the spot of Work is on everyone's mouth, especially now that there is little left to October 31 in London where a sixth of the population produces a third of the GDP The reasons against Brexit according to Marco are evident from the escape of European talents who once had salaries to be earned advantageously in Euro before the pound collapsed is under the eyes of all the economic uncertainty continues Marco is seen in everyday things with prices that go up and salaries properties supermarkets and pharmacies begin to get their hands forward making it known that at the turn of the Brexit date The stocks could end and the government continues the government has just allocated more than two billions of pounds also to stock up on medicines seems to advance towards a war economy we all make a good face in a bad game and we try to get to the fateful date as if nothing had happened but this summer the British have tasted the real cost of Brexit when theirs Holidays in Europe and America cost the 20 more than in 2016, read in 2016 also in Germany they chose me by reading among the hobbies of my curriculum in Italy little money and negativity who makes a choice like Marco makes a jump in the dark leave friends And relatives must accept at least at the beginning of not being brilliant in a new language of being immigrant not to vote for the government that dictates the rules of your life and must put into account that finding a job and making space will be more difficult because you will be looked at with The eyes with which an employer in Italy Gua rda a Romanian a Croatian or a Moroccan who asks for work but to return at the moment it seems a distant hypothesis if I could transport my current lifestyle to Italy and even some more money on the current account perhaps I would come back and I would like to see my son grow up growing Sports and activities that contrary to what one might think are more difficult to find but the reality is that with an Italian salary it remains little at the end of the month and would become an almost insurmountable problem even just go to see our family members in New Zealand and Hong kong

Italian researchers also stand out in the ERC funding ranking, the European Council of ERC Research which in its last call has allocated 621 million to help careers of 408 young researchers in all the Italians are 37 the third largest group after the Germans 72 And the French 38 but only 18 work in 13 Italian institutions the proportion of the Italian recipients of the loans confirms the trend of recent years in 2018 the Italians were second for the number of research bags but 2 out of 3 worked abroad and were second behind the Germans Also in 2016 when the ERC funds had been at the center of the political controversy, the former Minister of Education Stefania Giannini had in fact exulted on Facebook for the awarding of 30 Italian researchers, however, forgetting to say that 17 were brains on the run and that therefore those funds they had won a post that had triggered the reaction of many expats engaged in the research between them also Roberta D Alessandro 42 years old director of the Department of Italian language and culture of Leiden who had reminded the minister how abroad unlike what happens in Italy they give us the best places take them seriously i ERC Funds are distributed to the winners of the ERC Starting Grant Competition which is part of the EU Horizon 2020 L aim research and innovation program is to allow researchers to build their groups in order to conduct their innovative research, the ambitious financing will help individual scientists e Scholars to build their teams and conduct pioneering research in all disciplines reads in a note from the ERC The winners in Italy among the winners of 51 nationalities there are 37 Italians with a slight prevalence of men even if as they show the tables diffused by the ERC Most tricolor brains will bring forward the P Roprio Project abroad, however, it appears as a guest country of 18 projects and among the names of researchers who will work there several foreign scientists appear with four projects financed the Italian Iit technology institute is in the first place among the Italian bodies that have been awarded the Fund to propose the projects are Francesco di Stasio Genovese returned from Spain to develop components intended for the computers of the future The German Ilka Kriegel who works on a new material to make the accumulation of solar energy the Iranian Arash Ajoudani more efficient who studies the interactions between man And robot in the Sicilian Sicilian Sicily factories in Naples which is working on techniques to make immunotherapy against tumors more efficient by genetically changing the T cells of the immune system studies immune cells also Giulia Pasqual of the University of Padua and originally from Jesolo Venice what Study communication for SV The therapies against tumors and inflammatory and autoimmune tumors, the Italian Franco Jean Michel Cioni of the IRCCS San Raffaele in Milan seek in nerve cells the key to better understand neurodegenerative diseases compared to the size of the proteins and molecules that make them work the cell is enormous As a big city he observes Cioni and to understand its operation it is essential to understand how molecules are in the right place and at the right time the technologies to reduce carbon in the sources of energy decarbonisation are the goal of the research of Elena Verdolini who works at the Mediterranean euro center on CMCC climate change, the University of Brescia and the European Institute on Economics and the Environment Eiee The Italian structures that have received funds are 13 l Italian Institute of Technology, seat of 4 projects, the San Raffaele Hospital of Milan 1 Catholic University 1 Bocconi of Milan 2 Federico II of Naples 2 of Genoa 1 Ferrara 1 Padua 1 Pavia 1 and Trento 1 The Polytechnic of Milan 1 and that of Turin 1 The Mediterranean euro center on climate change 1 the loans and the record of nationality in General research financed by the ERC will be conducted in 24 countries with Germany United Kingdom and Netherlands that host the largest number of projects respectively 73 64 and 53 out of a total of 3 106 proposed projects has been successful on 13 1 and it is estimated that the funds The fields will help to create about 2 500 jobs, the projects that have obtained a Grant range from the sector of the engineering physical sciences 178 to the life sciences 115 to the social and human ones 115 The record lies in the nationality of the 408 researchers who come from Ben 51 countries from Taiwan to Cuba and about 20 will move to Europe this according to the Prime Minister Europe Or research Jean Pierre Bourguignon reminds us that science knows no boundaries and that talent is found wherever it is essential that for its future successful development, the European Union continues to attract and support excellent researchers from all over the world all ERC we are proud of contribute to this goal by supporting some of the most daring scientific talents very varied also the fields of study of the winners almost all engaged in border research from how the food present in the forests could provide a solution to hunger in the world to how high tech companies sell i their products and seek consumer trust up to climate change and level of oceans, researchers need freedom and support to follow their scientific curiosity if we want to find the answers to the most difficult challenges of our era and our future has observed Carlos Moedas European Commissioner for Research Science and Innovation And this added is the strength of the funding that the EU offers through the European Research Council an opportunity for exceptional scientists to pursue their most daring ideas
There is those who leave Italy without looking back convinced that it is the only possible way for Andrea Bussoletti 34 year old from Arcevia to the Marche region was not so moved from the other part of the world without networks or contacts was a very hard decision but it was the right one to get here It was the greatest fortune that I could have Andrea is the university professor in Guadalajara the second Mexico city from there is Monica his wife also a professor known in Florence while both studied political sciences as soon as I finished the doctorate in 2014 we got married and we are Parties more I approached at the end of the most I understood that I would never have found space in the research I don't blame my masters whose excellent memory I have but there was an objective scarcity of resources that limited the calls and places available like this to the maximum I was convinced by Monica and I made madness I had already been to Guadalajara a Knowing his family and I must say that the city had not even particularly liked it after almost 5 years that I live here I would not go to the world in the world, I also read veterinarian in Melbourne in Italy unacceptable conditions after graduation in many exploit young colleagues Arrived in Mexico Andrea begins to work as a communication consultant for a agency managed by friends of his wife I knew that I could not have immediately entered the universities who here as in Italy has his time remembers but what struck me immediately is the prestige that Everyone recognized my title as a research doctor was an extra gear even at the time of contracting the salary in Italy I was used to being looked at by the high as one as one who is not really working a maintained by the state that does not make anything useful not I didn't even count the arrows more directed or indirect I think it is due to a devaluing conception of those who study an evil that Italy cannot get rid of after a year comes the first assignment in a private university then the passage to the state university of Guadalajara at the beginning I was paid in lessons then In the summer of 2016 I obtained the place as a associate professor teaching contemporary history theory of democracy and political science last year instead I became a researcher who is a further and different qualification here compared to that of professor with the title of researcher is accessed by the national system of Search for an incentive mechanism for scientific productivity for which the better and better publish more earnings those who place themselves in the highest productivity range come to double their salary 1 6 The greatest difference between the academic environments of Italy and Mexico according to Andrea lies in meritocracy things are not easy even here but for what I had the opportunity to see if you work hard and give the best at the end you come repaired in Italy unfortunately it is not so it it I see in the Esperi Enza of my colleagues who have remained you can also split your back but you are never sure to do it is a mined field the other positive aspect tells is the lively environment open to young people the university has financed us the creation of an electoral observatory composed of us Professors and our students in Italy would have been almost impossible to have institutional support for an initiative so the trend is to protect the existing income and leave out the door who tries to enter and the baronata says almost does not exist but I think it is a matter of As far as scarce are resources, however, in Italy when there are funds for everyone the arrogance and abuse have no reason to exist laws I also emigrated to Madagascar told me that I was crazy my future could not be in Milan Andrea and Monica have a fig Lio Adrian who is two years old and is growing as a Mexican I try to talk to him also in Italian but often I forget he admits him every summer I take him to Italy to find his grandparents and my friends of a lifetime but lately I no longer recognize the country that has raised me The tone of political discussion has become extreme and not very reasonable as if anyone comes from outside was a criminal or a killer I feel like a fish out of water and my biggest fear is that one day my family in Italy is no longer The welcome that someone tells my son you are not from here returns to your home and it is a trend that is also infecting the Mexicans who during the passage of the caravan directed in the USA last autumn resembled a lot to Trump and Salvini saw a worst soul and Different also in this people usually so welcoming in Andrea's plans at least for the moment there is not to return to Mexico I am very well I am not intended To move I am sorry that my son does not know the environment in which I grew up that he never sees his grandparents but above all I wish in Italy he felt at home as I felt here
Thinking about the future for her means doing research and teaching the university for him instead continue to be a manager or open a startup perhaps returning to Italy Chiara Bulgarelli 30 year old Modenese and his partner Alvise Fornasier 29 year old Venetian met in London where they live and work there They have brought together some common friends mostly expats as they have been engaged for a couple of years and have coexisted for a few weeks in their apartment in the center of the British metropolis a couple of brains fleeing par excellence of an international site he is a researcher specialized in neuroscience she two 110 and praise that left Italy to achieve new professional and life objectives at the beginning was not easy but with sacrifices and determination we built us prospects that make us happy our country is unfortunately too closed in itself lawsAlso in Denmark I am a masterful work and I am independent in Italy brilliant graduates paid with reimbursements of the Alvise expenses born and raised among the channels of Venice graduated in tourism economics in Ca Foscari in 2012 specializing in the development of tourist systems in 2014 before finishing The studies obtained a three -month internship at the London headquarters of an important site and travel clubs known internationally an experience that became the object of her thesis after graduation worked for a year for a tourist web marketing company in Laguna Until he received the phone call from his former tutor who proposed to him to return to the United Kingdom in Italy I already had a permanent contract but I preferred to put myself involved tells the selection to be hired in the corporation that has about 3500 employees in The whole world is tough I have passed Ott Or interviews for a first year of the Chiara Emilian contract of Carpi graduated from the Liceo Classico graduated in 2011 in Psychology in Parma, then specializing in 2013 at the San Raffaele in Milan the last year of university I approached Neuroimmagini I wanted to study the relationship between the Mind and the different areas of the brain so a path began that brought it from Milan to the United Kingdom and in the USA I made an internship at the Utual University of Southern California in Los Angeles to understand Com abroad and I was satisfied so much It is true that in 2015 he left the Milan laboratory for the doctorate at the Birkbeck College London where he worked on a neuroimmagini project with children from six months to three years thanks to an innovative technique La Fnurs Functional Near Infrated Spectroscopy to study L brain activity we use helmets with sensors that emit light in the cerebral cortex and tell us if the AR Ee are active laws also emigrated to Madagascar told me that I was crazy my future could not be in Milan the impact with the new London life before even getting to know each other it was not all downhill within two years but for Alvise they arrived first The permanent contract and then the transition from Key Account Executive to Key Account Manager I understood that there was confidence in me here I feel appreciated and not only the constant salary increases now show it in the SOHO Square offices manages the relationship between the site for which he works and the online travel agencies booking portals that play a central role in tourist web marketing based in Italy Spain Greece Turkey and the Middle East who promote their prices on the portal are the contact of the company towards them and I take care as a consultant The optimization of their C AMPAGNE The perspective is now to cover the whole European continent and to become by the end of the year at 29 years of age Senior Key Account Manager I am the youngest of my team The international work environment I have colleagues from all over the world and the climate among us is very convivial Last year Alvise returned to Venice to keep a lesson at the university master of economics and tourism management an experience that for him was an emotion and also Chiara is optimistic about his prospects his work with children continued throughout the doctorate And it also continues in the post DOC started last January at the prestigious UCL University College London among the best 15 in the world according to international rankings in collaboration with the Boston Children S Hospital of the American University of Harvard C is a great interdisciplinarity tells work every day in contact with physicists and engineers also read At Shanghai at the age of 25 I am already at the head of a team return to Italy I would not be exploited and underestimated as well as keeping lessons to the university behind it already has several conference experiences around the world from Vienna to Vancouver from Tokyo to Rome in 2016 has Won a two -week bag reserved for 30 students from all over the world to the UCLA University of California Los Angeles paid by the American government and two years later it was the protagonist of two documentaries on the development neuroscience activities through FNIRS aired on the BBC but I I still feel at the beginning of the career explains Chiara that does not deny my studies in Italy, on the contrary, Italian students are well seen because our theoretical preparation is excellent even if little marked by the practice many in the United Kingdom begin the doctorate after the three -year the life of two Italians in London dear but very satisfying they repeat entr Ambi is a living city where everything you are looking for there is it seems to have the world in your pocket says Chiara that when she can sling up at the Tate Modern or to hear some concerts the services are excellent and everyone feels at home even if they come from another The country tells Alvise according to which no one in London could have foreseen Brexit we are not afraid of it directly but we consider it a negative choice in many respects in a year they will both be able to ask for the citizenship of the United Kingdom but they will not abandon that of family and friends origin are missing from both But for now we are not talking about it in Italy there is little meritocracy and the connection between the university and the research on the one hand and the work on the other is missing Alvise L Italia is fossilized should internationalize and invest in technology
Luca remembers the moment of his departure that he took him away from Italy I cried for an hour while I was on the flight was the strangest feeling that he ever tried to meet an uncertain future of not knowing what awaits you on the other side of the world and what will be of your life 25 years from Perugia Luca Massetti lives in Australia to follow his veterinarian PHD in Italy it is really difficult to accept the conditions in which we veterinarians are after graduating after the middle school council e Professors of Luca was to choose the hotel school and instead I did the scientific then smiles the veterinary test was my only opportunity I liked because the faculty united my two greatest passions of always science and animals after 5 years of Studio Matto and desperate Luca graduated with flying colors and after passing the umpteenth test d entrance together with some sporadic jobs begins The specialization in animal health and hygiene of the productions, however, I felt not to be satisfied then I started looking for opportunities abroad explains also veterinary laws in the United Kingdom if I could come back tomorrow but I am terrified here even at 60 you can change jobs so it ends in Australia here In Melbourne, people are very friendly even if I do not hide that at the beginning to find friendships and stability it was not easy I think that the Italian warmth is missing here despite the pulls of compatriots of restaurants and bars we live more than day compared to us the day of work Di Luca varies a lot depending on the week for now I am in the first year of PHD so work on literature I am focusing on the development of new biomolecular techniques for the diagnosis of dog parasites divides myself between the study laboratory and preparation of the Logistics for next year when I receive samples from dogs from the main Australian cities for Luca who comes from a small town in Central Italy The arrival in a metropolis was a great discovery, the city offers many options cinema theater music events food and people from everything In short, the world if I had to describe Melbourne in an eclectic word I would say the panorama is different from that of Perugia as well as the Australian salaries are anything else than the Italian ones on average are much higher for the same work even if we talk about waiters and bartenders there Quality of life here is better and Luca despite having only a scholarship is able to cover taxes and insurance lives and leisure melbourne will not be hot as Italy but the value of being a multi -ethnic and multicultural city explains Luca is the absence of prejudices And then here he realized his dreams like seeing whales and pink lakes swimming with The seals also read veterinarian in Liverpool they told me that I had to work for free and I made the suitcases in Italy I was increasingly frustrated the nostalgia of the house is heard on the side of the affections of the friends of the family and the climate of his four dogs and the cat of the house and truffle is a nostalgia that is sometimes difficult to fight and I wonder what will happen in the coming years how the lives of the people I know otherwise says my future is not here is not here is only a stage of my life if I will not be able to return to Italy at least I hope to return to Europe remains the fact that Luca no longer wants to be satisfied it is really difficult to accept the conditions in which we veterinarians in Italy are after graduating 400 euros per month to work 8 hours a day if it's okay to do night shifts for 25 50 euros some must pa races to be able to enter the renowned clinics and thus make that experience required on the curriculum no this does not make the working situation for me veterinarians in Italy is hard and it is the same for many many indeed almost all of them exploit young recent graduate colleagues offering internship opportunities to A few hundred euros a month by leveraging that from recent graduates you still have to learn to do this job in Italy you really need a lot but so much passion the money is not everything is true but it is frustrating to find yourself after years and years of study with a lot lower than that which could have been obtained with work that does not require professionalizing degrees
 When my Milanese friends graduated I already had two years of work experience now with the specialist and a Master many are in internship when it is good for this to return to Italy scares me Beatrice Ugolini graduated in the United States and now works in Shanghai In China where he directs an office of University Counseling in an international high school, therefore he deals with the orientation of high school students in view of the University a figure who in Italy does not exist Beatrice fluently three languages ??is head of the department and coordinates a team of six people an assignment of Responsibility obtained at the age of 25 when his Italian friends on average entered the world of work I made a bachelor at Bennington college a path of study that would correspond to the short degree and it was enough to find work in Italy I would never have been taken seriously The turning point for Beatrice arrives when she is a student at the Beccaria high school in Milan decides to F Requenting the penultimate year in the United States against the opinion of my teachers underlines more worried about the maturity that of my future I will perhaps have neglected the study of Latin and the Greek but that year abroad changed my life just returned to Italy for the last year Liceo applies to continue his university studies overseas and enters Benningon College in Vermont to study liberal arts in Italy there is nothing like this is a path that aims to a wide general knowledge in which the as we learn that it is learned that the thing I was able to build my faculty of the way by doing in the study plan inserts philosophy Chinese history and culture philosophy now I realize that I made the right choice, the Chinese is the language of the future in the United States some schools already teach it in elementary laws also in the dreams denied work In black my story symbol of a sick Italy The other date to be marked in red on the calendar is the summer of 2018 moved to China where she had already passed a semester in the university years country with an ancient culture suspended between tradition and fascinating but full progress The Chinese attitude today is very popular and oriented towards earnings, therefore we always work on Sundays or days of closures coexistence with foreigners explains it is not always easy even because of a difficult historical heritage, the post -colonial legacy resists the stereotype Of the rich western who just wants to make money, the Chinese are very proud of their national identity, the division with foreigners is more or less clear depending on where you go here in Shanghai, however I found very open people who want to share their Beatrice culture tells of the relationship of trust that has been created with the neighbors Like the eighty -year -old lady who collects the mail even if they do not know her personally if they meet you at lunchtime ask you if you have eaten it is an indirect way to ask you if you are well read in Albania I found work and I am independent a dignified salary in Italy is A Utopia Beatrice tells China's contradictions such as the internet censorship there is a paid service offered via VPN app with which you can navigate on Google or on Facebook apparently does not change anything but there are moments in which the government takes away this privilege like the June 4 Anniversary of the massacre in Piazza Tiananmen The government has limited internet access by obscuring many contents for Chinese history does not exist as if it never happened many of my colleagues do not know exactly what happened instead the indispensable app is WeChat Co nor do you really make everything chat is called a taxi you pay the house I practically never carry the wallet confirms Beatrice the thing that amazes her most is the way shopping here there are no supermarkets except western ones you buy In the markets scattered throughout the streets of Shanghai but almost all of them get delivered at home costs very little and arrives within half an hour as the online orders buy in the morning and you receive it in the afternoon the thing that fascinates it most is to see people Dance in the evening in the parks especially the elderly in the morning make Tai Chi and in the evening they dance are very careful to the health Beatrice talks about her new life with a smile and adds I realized that it is often lacking in Italy her sincerity is taken as An affront to one's origins explains with bitterness but living by the other part of the globe involves sacrifices like when her grandparents died and she didn't n has never been able to return for the funeral or the awareness that all the time spent far from his family cannot be recovered C is always a little sadness and regret at the end of a call on Skype with my parents but when they ask if he will come back He has no doubts perhaps ever looking at the work experiences of my friends I am afraid that I would be underestimated here exploited and underpaid when I read the statistics on graduates and work I wonder what I would do now if I had remained in Italy perhaps in the end I would have gone abroad anyway, read Istat anyway I lost 420 thousand Italians since 2008 Fico is at risk the future of the country Beatrice continues to follow the news coming from Italy inquires and has devoted to the latest policies I would like our government to take care of how much human capital will enter Italy to which it does not let's give resources per H are refugees and we perceive their human value as lower than ours what annoys it the most he says is the grudge towards those who choose to leave I see an annoying tendency to point the finger at the boys who choose to leave we don't go to escape but In order to grow and improve we are all moving in the globalized world we want to learn as much as possible from other countries and perhaps one day to be able to return all this to ours
At 20, Giorgio Maggioni Statistics student at the University of Milan finds a job at an Italian travel agency in Nosy Be Isletta in northern Madagascar was my first abroad experience I still remember very well the moment of returning home one of the most important of my life when I decided that my future could not be limited to Milan so while at the beginning of the millennium his companions of studies make a career Giorgio Emigra with three thousand euros in his pocket in Madagascar in a few thought they kicked that era and I was seen as a crazy adventurer today at the age of 45 Giorgio lives and works in Madagascar here I reached a level that I could not even dream of remaining in Italy Giorgio went to live alone at the age of 19 for a long time I was a student and worker alternating first studies in Italian literature and then in statistics to many works especially in tourism and catering in both Milan and The rest of Italy as seasonal recalls the first experience in Madagascar was born precisely to pay for her studies in an Italian tourist agency of Nosy Be there my life began in Madagascar that led me subsequently to be a restaurateur real estate agent expert in collectible stones And also a developer of websites until I dedicate myself almost exclusively to tourism, read also to Valencia I manage two hostels I enjoy and life is not dear in Italy there is a lot of melancholy, the reception was excellent I arrived in a country very different from the one from which I came from Initially blocked by a poor knowledge of the language and local customs there is those who at the beginning tried to take advantage of the young migrant Italian but in the end they have given the difference between a western culture and a unique one like that of the Madagascar for Giorgio is immense He explains it is true that often in the most remote countryside the arrival of a white still arouses amazement but the reception and smile of the Malgasci have never given me any problems tells looking at the bureaucracy in Madagascar is rather simplified it is possible to open a company in a couple of days and easily manage the accounting explains Giorgio what is lacking in Italy surely the quality of public services often angry I feel like Italians do not understand the luck of having health and free education a very precious good that few in the world can afford here for a French school you have to Fun from more than three thousand euros per year and a good hospital is not even paid to the law also in Denmark I make the masterful work and I am independent in Italy bright graduates paid with reimbursement of expenses since 2001 Giorgio has settled defin The third largest city in the country in the country today at 45 years of age deals with tourism, managing local agencies that enhance the territory, the typical day after bringing children to school I introduce myself to the office where I answer the customers contact hotels and guides nothing different From what I could have done in Italy I smile C is then to accompany tourists and follow them in their path I remember with great pleasure the group of 75 geologists and gemologists from 5 continents from 20 to 80 years that I followed step by step on a visit Three weeks in Madagascar with each other c were world -renowned academics was a bit like taking professors to the trip but there are also advantages from an economic point of view to live in Madagascar, tourism lives a moment of great development tells I could not have achieved this lifestyle in Italy where however Giorgio invests his savings but if he looks to his country he sees many m stagnation Iei companions of high school and university find themselves fitted in works that do not satisfy them both humanly and from an economic point of view and many questions are asked about their future
 To carry out the project of my life I did something that ten years ago I believed Impossible I went back to Italy because sometimes even those who have chosen to leave can decide to pull the brake around and retrace the way home as happened to Fausto Panizzolo Biogenase 37 years of age returned to his Padua to develop a wearable exoskeleton that improves the movement of the body after more than seven years spent as a researcher between Canada Australia United States I have returned to be able to give life to a dream to be able to help those who suffered an injury or who It is suffering from pathologies that reduce mobility to walk more easily and in the future because not restoring this possibility to those who no longer be able to read 2 million emigrants from the south in 15 years to the farewell to young people and qualified workers in Harvard where he has worked at the s Viluppo of light exoskeletters who took shape the idea of ??patenting the application in the medical field during the years in Boston my laboratory has been visited by personalities such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates as well as by students and researchers from all over the world and yet the meeting that will push him to undertake a new adventure is the one with another Italian stationed in the East Coast Livio Valenti already active in the medical field with a startup on a new type of heat resistant vaccines by comparing me on my idea of ??producing this type of device I am I realized that a similar technology was not available on the market but where to do it I wanted to be completely independent in the development of the patent and to be able to demonstrate that even in our country it is possible to start a company like this so do it in Italy for me it was really important from the meeting of two Young brains on the run was born Moveo Walks a dream that has become reality After various prototypes we have obtained an easily wearable soft exoskeleton that lightens motor fatigue explains Panizzolo is designed above all for the elderly but also for those with motor difficulties or those who are suffering from pathologies such as Sclerosis Stutus Parkinson's and Stenosis after a experimentation phase lasting several months who involved many of the patients of the Padua physiotherapy medical center, marketing and certification arrived at the Ministry of Health, Costanza repays when I returned I was only with my laptop to write the project and send email remember now we are seven to work on it Among them there is also a young seamstress we sought by belonging to this party of dreamers to maintain a dynamism a practicality and access to American resources with an Italian skill and dynamism read also In Albania I found work and I am independent of a dignified salary in Italy it is a utopia to do business with advanced technologies in Italy, however it is not easy even if you have a project that works I see myself in many guys who say that they have no space here is outside it is Better here says Fausto I would like to be able to demonstrate that it is not always so believe in our dreams often really makes the difference especially when you are willing to make more than some sacrifice even if the road is often uphill in Italy, the driving force of investments from part of the private individuals and with this I mean the incentive for which if you produce a thousand products then I finance to make it one thousand two hundred in the United States instead explains the system is different to finance ten startups that they consider potential nine they fail by completely losing the investment a win and with that Whoever put the money at the beginning won the whole jackpo T and this is the concept that allowed the development of those companies that have changed our world underlines it would redo everything from the head you must always go on reach the goals and fix new ones and launch an appeal we are here if someone wants to come forward and Investing in us we are sure we can create a successful business and at the same time improving the life of many with few resources we have already done a lot and we would like to be able to do even more

 The reality in Southern Italy is depressing as soon as I graduated I did not see the time to throw myself into the world of work I had enthusiasm and desire to do but also fear because in addition to giving repetitions or doing occasional jobs from the promoter to the summer camps I had never had the opportunity to find something Thus Ida Nastasi 30 years old who grew up in the province of Caserta but originally from Torre del Greco in 2017, he chose to reach his boyfriend who emigrated for work in Albania and there the first remained to clash with the working depression of Southern Italy was him In Tirana today he is fine smiles the first time he left to reach it Ida was excited I was about to see my boyfriend after months remember had to be a summer holiday before returning home in September more charged than before and instead Ida returned only to take your luggage and move 1 3 with her boyfriend He says it clearly is Tondo he felt forced to leave his country after graduation I had started looking for work but I only came across the fixed -term contracts or unpaid internships then attempts the way to the school for some substitutes in the North Italy enrolls in the third band but nothing the work of the teacher is really precarious and if you do not have an support, economic support is difficult I was very demotivated, read our project to not make tomorrow's managers emigrate our companies they need them then The opportunity has arrived in Albania Ida today works in a web marketing agency such as editor and copywriter in Tirana yes To the good most of the Albanians know Italian for learning it at school or because it has grown by watching Rai and Mediaset tells the cost of living is low and there are evident economic advantages for an Italian starting from the price of the bus ticket to the taxi o To cigarettes the fact that the manpower costs much less helped by a lower labor cost translates into low prices everywhere by the restaurants to the dentist to the beauty center or from the greengrocer and even the search for a rent does not involve an economic concern there are acceptable houses Already furnished at very good prices, the day of Ida starts with a coffee fortunately in many bars, the coffee is very good just specify that I want it short and after ten minutes by bus it is in the office on the pc I start to review the texts that send me the Various teams The consultants or my colleagues I correct the contents for graphic proposals or form training we collaborate for the creation of posts for social media and advertising campaigns and then I dedicate myself to the company blog for which I write every week in the past I also made Italian and communication courses for consultants by evaluating them per level explains in some cases though The differences with Italy are marked I find that there is a lot of backwardness in the ways of thinking continuous Ida I adapted to local uses and customs with great patience by resigning myself to refer to when I am in Italy or things that it is impossible to do or find laws here Even veterinary in the United Kingdom if I could return tomorrow but I am terrified here even at 60 years of age you can change work by the way to return to Italy Ida would still be struggling with precariousness my country at this moment are only my affections I look at it with nostalgia and I miss all qu Ello that I lived and loved until a few years ago when I assail the nostalgia I think how I live now on my independence to the expenses I can face myself and I know very well that I could not have the same things while staying in my city I would be However, he had to leave and move to northern Italy adds Ida explains his position and that of his generation with extreme clarity inserting himself in the world of work for children like us of 28 29 30 years is increasingly difficult then the 20 -year -olds arrive who overtake you because they are presumed to you That at 30 he is already skills and skills in Italy there are many perhaps too many things to change as he imagines his future hopes to get closer to his family and find a stable job in Italy with a dignified salary that allows her to be able to pay rent bills and shopping what seems obvious concludes in Italy today looks like a utopia
A scholarship financed by former students for other students this is the idea of ??the Alumni Association of the Superior College of Bologna to provide those who are about to finish their studies an economic contribution to spend a period abroad perhaps for an extra thesis project explains the President Paolo Annibale is a way to return to the system something of the excellent training received our university has an excellent level of certain is full of flaws but then those who have come out turns the criticisms in a constructive way and say well what I can do to give one Concretely Paolo Annibale graduate in Physics at the University of Bologna coordinates the Association of the former pupils of the Superior College, a d of Excellence of the University of Bologna a group of former students quite small about 300 people scattered here and there of which many abroad but always remained In contact everyone agreed on the fact that we had from Italy u Na formation of excellent quality and we wondered how we could do something useful to reciprocate at least symbolically so two scholarships were born worth 1500 euros each to support study periods or projects abroad the first two students to have received it I am Lorenzo Rosa Information Engineering who chose the United States and Francesca Basini Statistical Sciences both in the photo that started for Ireland compared to the question, the mobility bags of university are not always sufficient to cover the request we thought of bags that were very simple from point of view of the bureaucracy and that they could cover many different things the real news is that they are financed by former students through an internal subscription to the association we have given ourselves a goal to be achieved through donations in complete freedom on next year we would like to do some Fundraising external to increase the value of the two Bags or offer more according to Istat 28 thousand graduates have left Italy in 2017 but it must not necessarily be a road without return to Annibale a period at the foreign one should not be intended as a one way ticket but rather as the opportunity to make a training experience Regardless of where its future career will develop on the phenomenon of the brain on the run there are several myths to dispel the first explain Annibale is that whoever remains is a loser or a child or that on the contrary those who leave abandon their country the second metropolitan legend He adds is that abroad is always better, the barons also exist in other countries, the rigged competitions also exist elsewhere, Italy has major problems of resources and transparency but it is a simplification to think that it is enough to cross the border to find the country of the Balocchi Annibale He worked in Switzerland in the United States and now in Germany in VI Rt of his abroad experience can testify to the validity of the Italian system, our graduates receive an excellent preparation says and demonstrate it with the results that also achieve abroad from these considerations was born the idea of ??the scholarship the purpose is to return something of that who has received each other by helping other students who do not have the means to spend a period abroad, the point is to provide the tools to choose independently how and where to develop their career especially to those who are at the beginning of his path or still uncertain according to the last report Istat on the labor market four years after the achievement of the title almost a doctor of research on five lives and works abroad that of Brain Drain The brain leak is a growing phenomenon a loss of human capital and ultimately also economic people formed at the expense of the Italian system which then invest their potential elsewhere Ca is international it is natural to be on the move Annibale in Italy, if anything, the anomaly is that the phenomenon is unbalanced towards abroad, that is to say Italy loses more talents than those who acquire the Istat confirms that only the 26 of the foreign students who have achieved the PhD in Italy is still present in our territory for the majority of them so Italy has only been a step in passing, the newly formed scholarship from students for students was experienced only among the students of the Superior College of Bologna not for elitism But for reasons of simplicity it is a small group and it is easier to coordinate Annibale but the hope and ambition is that it is replicated by other associations of former pupils in other universities for us it was almost a civic responsibility but anyone can do it in any university not It is unthinkable that those who are experiencing a career successfully and satisfaction stop for D Omanda but what can I do to improve the university from which I came out
 The day of the discussion of my degree thesis one of my professors advised me to go to Malta to study English and make the specialist on the way back to Librizzi the country where my parents and I was born we immediately discussed this Possibility and them because you do not try for Andrea Consalvo 30 -year -olds originally from the province of Messina to move to Malta has meant becoming brand manager in a handful of months now has lived for six years in the island the smallest state of the union which is today one of the European nations With the lowest unemployment rate and with the most impetuous economic growth, I also read musician in Paris, my lives paid twice as much as Italy here to do the artist is a job at La Valletta Andrea came after the three -year degree in Messina in Tourism Economy and of the environment V Isto that in Sicily the opportunities to find work were very few after graduation therefore thought of opening up to new experiences to other perspectives and so the week after was already in Malta for months I attended an English course bringing home the attestation necessary for the Registration for the University I chose the specialist in Integrated Marketing Communications in a course offered by the University of Malta in collaboration with the King S College London obtained the degree I was chosen as one of the testimonials of the course my first great satisfaction once the specialist is over Finding work was a question of little shortly thereafter the hiring as manager of the Nativity Museum of the Maltese capital and this was only the beginning of two years ago was in fact hired with a permanent contract by a company that works for one great American multinational and today it has become brand manager in 2018 one of the My projects was chosen as Monster Best Practice and shared with other companies in Europe he explains and according to him all his professional passages that occurred quickly in Italy would not have been possible in Malta the Bada recruitment system to the Sodo are looking for the merit. Campo immediately gave me confidence and apical assignments despite being a point a point not to underestimate for those who move to Malta, however, it is the cost of living here the taxes affect the salaries much less than in Italy but the rentals are constantly increasing year after year The specialized workers then fail to save much in my case I consider myself lucky because I have a permanent contract that guarantees me a higher salary than the average as well as fundamental services such as health insurance read also abroad st St. The highest one of 61 we lose human capital perfect Andrea is among the many Italians who have chosen Malta over the years has met hundreds of other compatriots who have moved like him pushed by the work outlets that he promises on the basis of his experience explains that they are The same large companies operating on the island having to compete to grab the best talents to guarantee the rights of workers the climate the sea and the landscapes from which it is surrounded today remind him of his land of origin but over the years he has been able to see that in Malta the prospects Upon the same starting conditions, there are different ones there are also renunciations to do it as for example returning to Sicily only once in the year the family and friends I miss a lot and in the evening after the work I continue to study to improve myself but that's okay here I am very well
 I went away on August 28, 2017 I reached Denmark driving for 1 600 kilometers in the morning but before taking the highway I passed near the most beautiful and important places that marked my life Nicola Muner is 24 years old and is originally from Cividale of Friuli in the province of Udine after the three -year degree, he decided to move to Denmark here as a student received a house from the University and the state gives him a monthly compensation thanks to the Sour Job system with illness and holidays paid for many of my old companions return of the course intelligent and brilliant people after graduating in Italy live with reimbursement of expenses for less than 500 euros per month tells and yet the reception was not beautiful have checked all the cars that did not have a Scandinavian or German plaque on the border reminiscent of Nicola all university instead The situation turned upside down gave me accommodation so I arrived without the thought of finding ca he knows in a foreign land and it is a great advantage tells at home we are 8 tenants of 8 different nationalities and we have all become good friends during the three -year Nicola discovered the interest in logistics, unfortunately, however my course in economics did not allow me to continue the masterful in Italy so I started looking for courses abroad so it ended up in Denmark from a certain point of view yes I was forced to emigrate laws also Istat in 157 thousand away from Italy in 2018 they grow expat that return from abroad the day type it depends if yes goes to the university or to work Nicola deals with the management of the petrol bogs in a maritime agency in the office, the atmosphere is relaxed between colleagues every Friday then there is the Friday bar at 3 pm where we all gather and we tasty different wines The important thing is to have one Bike available Mez zo indispensable in Denmark he says and the differences compared to Italy are many the largest is digitalization in Denmark you do everything with the computer the lessons to the University The exams The practices with the public administration in two years I have never gone to any office everything Through e -mail and calls in Italy there are always many cards to be made especially by comparing the university system I came from a three -year one where everything was done with the protocol sheets or the tail in the secretariat continues, read the highest salary of the 61 highest salary.

The Istat had already talked about the Italians who abroad in the annual report and now in the dossier on the demographic budget addresses the theme of the migratory balance in 2008 the people who left our country were almost 157 thousand with an increase of 2 thousand units compared to 2017 Registration in the registry from foreign countries were reduced from almost 500 thousand in 2008 to 332 thousand of 2018 while the cancellations from the registry for abroad increased in a marked way from 80 thousand to 157 thousand in the decade the migratory balance with abroad was therefore reduced to 175 thousand units in 2018 in 2018, members of the registry from a foreign country decreased by 3 2 compared to 2017 are above all foreign citizens 85 9 even if the Italians who fall after a period of emigration abroad are growing compared to 2017 +10 5 are above all men who choose to move to Italy 55 7 contrary to what happened throughout the D Previous Ecennio when the women prevailing on the topic of Italians abroad were also intervened in the flows of foreign countries, the Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi also intervened, who in his opening of the plenary assembly of the general council of Italians abroad at the Farnesina underlining by underlining The value of the communities of Italians abroad in the reputation of the country said I do not believe in the myth of the escape of the brains I believe that the link with Italy is not lost and that the desire to represent Italy abroad and to return if there is the Possibility is common to all a factor that has also emerged in dozens of stories told in recent years by IlFattoquotidiano IT but the theme of the escape of the Italians abroad is nothing more than a myth and above all it is not negligible to say it is the relationships of Migrantes e of the Istat who in the annual report has detected the loss of 420 thousand Italians since 2008 a phenomenon that For the President of the Chamber Roberto Fico also puts the future of the country at risk and also the data of Almalaurea highlight a growing propensity to the emigration of our graduates and launches the alarm on the south which in 10 years risks being an empty shell highlighted trends highlighted Also from Ceps Think Tank based in Brussels that in the EU Mobile Workers study in Challenge to Public Financies he detected the brain drain, that is, the escape of the brains that is not compensated by other arrivals that has undergone Italy between 2007 and 2017 years in which At the same time he had to face a net immigration of the two lower preparation classes and based on the Aire data in the last year there are 123 193 those who have decided to transfer the residence abroad a number that is equivalent to the population of Monza or Pescara
When in 2003 the Baghdad Museum in Iraq Licia was sacked made a promise to herself returning as soon as possible and making its small contribution to that country in fact I was lucky remembered in February 2012 we went to Nassiriya for the First campaign of Sapienza in Abu Tbeirah the latest foreign troops had in fact left the country in early December and we finally resumed the archaeological activities Licia Romano was born in Catania and is 36 years since 2011 at only 27 years of age became responsible for the field management of the Italian Iraqi mission to Abu Tbeirah archaeological site of maximum importance for the country with his team Licia has brought to light a Sumerian city and a port of the third millennium before Christ which will allow to write a new chapter in the history of Mesopotamia and its civilization overcoming the common imagination that identifies the ancient Mesopotamian cities surrounded by expanses of Fields of cereals irrigated by artificial channels also read in the Netherlands everything started with the Erasmus and after three years the company already considers me Senior before arriving in Iraq Licia spent 7 years at the Ebla excavation in Syria I have always wanted to do the archaeologist And dealing with Near East Friends and relatives reactions have shared and supported my passion smiles but com is the life of an archaeologist who spends entire months abroad on the field is marked by rather tight rhythms tells during the excavation campaign The alarm clock is fixed to 4 in the morning at 5 the escort of the Iraqi archaeological police arrives at home mission located in the archaeological park of Ur the city where according to the Bible Abraham was born and we go to the site on the outskirts of Nassiriya around 8 pm some chatter goes to lett or in an attempt to earn a good number of hours of sleep, continues to be difficult in the first years of excavation the negative image that was of the Iraq that appeared as a country in war and not in the rebirth phase explains Licia with our mission we wanted to tell a Different country where not only is it possible to work but above all where the climate of collaboration with colleagues and premises is more than serene in 2012 for example there were only two archaeological missions active in southern Iraq while today I lost the continuous account the discoveries are always More numerous and from 2019 during the excavation campaign we visited the first buses of European and American tourists, read also veterinary in the United Kingdom if I could return tomorrow but I am terrified here even at 60 years of age you can change work to work close contact with colleagues and collaborators In short, Iraqis has enormously facilitated Licia L Iraq's task is among the most open countries in the world towards foreigners as confirmed the meetings and relationships that I have had the opportunity to weave in recent years add we have shared joys of birth weddings and I have been to They also side in the pain of the loss of a dear differences between Italy and Iraq often comes to me to think of all the problems that seem insurmountable in Italy and that suddenly become very small in front of what the Iraqis have faced and face the strength with which the force daily New Iraq and above all his young people are struggling to revive the country can only be inspired for us Italians Licia has a strong link with his country of origin are and I certainly feel Italian I grew up and lived in Italy and the Italy and the Sapienza have allowed me to carry on my working and research dream but I have to admit to s EXpardously European on one point in particular Licia is keen to say her on the basis of my experience I think that doing research in Italy is absolutely possible at the same time, however, I cannot deny that there are complex situations and that you can be forced to look for the Just scientific path elsewhere, I also read in Italy, I made the craftsman but my life was too stressful here in Mexico I started to live the future Licia continues I am a precarious of the research I was lucky enough to study and do research in my university La Sapienza that He is first in the world for classical studies and ancient history I do not hide therefore that I would like to continue here and yet I would have no problems going abroad, the important thing is that with the same quality of the research, both the Italian brains are equivalent to the escape and those left At home we also exist precisely for Licia, reality is increasingly varied than the one who present the mass media, moreover, concludes when my Iraqi colleagues and friends discovered my Sicilian origins the first thing they asked me was but you are not afraid of the mafia

 In Italy you can be formed as you want but if you don't have knowledge I don't work here after a month of sending curricula I can do what I studied with a more than dignified pay Marco Sollazzo is 30 years old comes from Rome is an oenologist and for three years lives In Australia after more than seven years of studies and with numerous publications behind it he was forced to move abroad to chase his dream despite Italy is the first producer to the world of wine a not simple choice but who says it is growing a lot here Even if you are nobody but you deserve the social lift works, it also explains laws we also import wine to Colombia where it smiles to the future, Italy is depressed and being young is a handicap her passion for nature has distant roots I have always preferred it tells the practical studies a Theoretical ones so in high school I have LTO A Technical Agricultural Institute that allowed with one year more to acquire the qualification of the unique wine batch from the second year from the second year the study of the English language was no longer expected which, however, tells me for me was a nightmare past the six years I had a job qualification but seen That I was good at school, however, decided to embark on his university career so Marco continues his path in the world of wine by graduating in 2011 in food technologies with specialization in viticulture and summer oenology during university pauses I could find work as a worker for the harvest like this I put together the theory with the practice I never thought I had talent but I always compensated with the determination then tells after the three -year decides to continue my studies there were not many options there are only three universities that offer a specialist in viticulture and oenology like this I chose Asti facing my first Esperi Enza outside the house The result is excellent Marco graduated in 2013 with full marks and obtains the publication of his thesis The road to a place as a researcher is flattened but he prefers to invest in another I had known people engaged in the scientific world that after 10 years They found themselves having to fight to get private funds for their research explains a life that did not do for me so I set aside the place as a researcher and I threw myself headlong in the world of work the situation in Italy, however, it is disappointing I understood that The curriculum counted little companies were looking for only young oenologists to be assumed with questionable contracts in which he ended up working as a cellarman worker Marco folds then on a plane B abroad I did not know English but I decided to invest my savings in a language course later Four months of full immersion in Dublin working during the day and attending courses in the evening Marco returns to Italy with love for the language and thinking that as a child I was disgusted after my return I started working for some of our local company but I immediately understood the trend says bitterly some companies consider you too specialized in others you only enter if you have knowledge so I have Wat on the internet what were the first vintors available in the rest of the world and the options were two Australia or South America, read also to Boston, I deal with the Made in Italy wine in our country, politics teaches that the smartest is also the most intelligent research Di Marco is frenetic I also sent 500 emails a day so much that I had to open another account because what I had already overloaded I was afraid of losing that little English that I had learned I was looking for Australian winry on Google and then I sent the curriculum and a presentation to all the companies that I found the first answers do not have Marco wait within a few weeks he already has six telephone events with as many Australian companies and thinking that in Italy many do not even respond to the emails after several interviews the final choice is between three companies only one of these offered me A contract as an oenologist assistant for three months to 22 dollars, more the extraordinary time tells Marco almost twice in Italy in practice so I chose her the impact with the other part of the world is not simple but Marco at the end stops six months the best According to Australian visas before returning to Italy where he still hopes to find work in the vineyards that I love so much I returned having put aside almost 7 thousand euros and I started to send curricula to Italian wine companies the impact once again was disappointing the only offer of work is in fact by the same company with which Marco has already worked as workers Or for the harvest when he still went to superiors they offered me even a lower wage than I took at 18 years of age I understood that there was nothing more to do and that Italy was completely failing I had to start again today Marco still lives in Australia where it is Back after the first seasonal experience in 2015 as a fixed worker in 2016 thanks to the confidence of the winery that hired him and who guaranteed for him has obtained a permanent visa and earns over 50 thousand dollars l year by doing the work of his dreams and yet despite the Australia says is very interesting from a naturalistic point of view, he is missing I am angry and embittered because despite my experience despite Italy is the first producer in the world of wines despite the sacrifice of my parents to make myself study I am forced to work outside concludes Marco If they offered me a job on equal condition I would come back but it is not that simple I miss the thrusts
Not only debt and demographic decline in the Annual Istat report there is also talk of Italian brain brains that have left the country in search of the best opportunities especially of work, the data outlines a net scenario The migratory balance with foreign Italians has been negative since 2008 And he produced a net loss of about 420 thousand residents about half 208 thousand ranges from 20 to 34 years and almost two out of three has an average high education a trend that does not stop as also indicate other reports from the Statistics Institute and in addition to young people who decide to expatriate those who make the choice to remain generally leave the family later by experiencing less linear life paths of the past that move forward the transition stages to the adult state more than half of the 20 34 -year -olds 5 5 million celibates and unmarried live with At least one parent to attract the attention of the President of the Chamber Roberto Fico during the presentation of the report It is precisely the escape of the brains that dramatically impresses the human capital of our country and puts at risk of it the future we must create the conditions said in the labor market as in research and universities to encourage our talents to stay or return after qualifying experiences At abroad he added therefore the need to remove the obstacles that stand in the realization of the life projects of young people has continued a specific consideration, deserves the systematic outflow of young people aged 20 to 34 with a high level of education from the regions of the South Towards the center north and from Italy to abroad for Fico to this to this is added the aggravation of the inequalities between men and women between territories between people with different levels of education between generations in our country in essence the low growth has accompanied itself to a greater one inequality only partially limited by the INT public ervent it is a negative spiral that must be stopped through appropriate measures to support the most fragile or in any case disadvantaged categories of the population
A place as a researcher in the United States found navigating a email magazine on the website of a email and the call for an impossible interview Jacopo Baglieri Ragusano researcher of 36 years has thus obtained the post from Post DOC to the UCLA The prestigious Californian University happened almost for Case was late at night and I looked on the Nature website, I sent the CV and a letter of presentation via email without too many hopes and instead they set me an interview in Italy to get a place as a researcher you have to pass infinite practical competitions expected not to mention the Posts already assigned by recommendations comments but here things are much simpler and direct laws also abroad graduates higher salary than 61 we lose human capital perfect jacopo has been in the United States for seven years but to leave Italy not It was his plans I wanted to have an experience outside yes but then I thought I returned in 2008 he graduated in biotechnology of the drug in Milan and started looking around I wanted to do research but everyone advised me advised to do it in Italy even the colleagues of the laboratory in which I prepared the thesis then I started sending curricula carpet to Europe he passes three months in London to perfect the language and then he is taken at the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom for the PhD for more than three years is part of a European project of research subsidized by the Marie Curie Bag Curie The England is not an easy country in which to settle but the project was excellent gave me the opportunity to travel and get to know many European researchers finished the difficult English experience but it gradually improved returning to Ragusa for a Short period but is now convinced that I can do research only abroad I practically return to the holidays The possibilities in Italy had not improved I was hoping for an increase in funds in a change in those conditions was difficult so I decided to continue my path abroad the United States are the place that most attracts it excellent investments to research but a lot of bureaucracy for power access were a bit the next step but getting the visa is complicated so I did not have many hopes, however, an opportunity arrives in an extraordinarily simple way by sailing among the announcements of the site of the Nature magazine a few days later the answer to his email then the interview comes Skype and the departure towards Los Angeles unlike England who looks at foreigners with a little distrust in California Jacopo finds a small wonderful climate Sicily and welcoming people and if you are Italian he says you have an extra gear our country has a very strong charm here they light up when you say where you come from READ ALSO ENGINEERS IN HOLLA everything started with LESMUS and after three years the company already considers me senior in the UCLA laboratories, its team experiences possible therapies for muscle dystrophy Jacopo has now married and lives in San Diego near the border where Trump wants Building the wall if it ever is done says and then adds we hope not to university its study area is liver cancer in an attempt to find new therapeutic targets who makes research must be motivated by a great passion is a competitive and tiring road i results do not always arrive you have to take a lot of time into account and many failed experiments before finding the right path pushes you the awareness that what you do could really save lives is an international environment explains therefore the exchange of ideas and people of different is natural nationality but confesses that G I would like his country to recognize the work that Jacopo does is convinced that the Italian University has nothing to envy to the American one except for an appearance we make so much theory we lack practice we study well but in the United States the boys are sent In the laboratory practically immediately from us, the thesis and the basic internship is expected to be a problem of public funding but it is a shame adds to let it go so much human capital how you invest well in training should be investing even after in the research, read Venice C also read Foscari attracts brains on the run and talents are the 18th of the hires since 2014 Jacopo says he has no particular nostalgia of the house but that he has not yet closed any door to the other bank of the Atlantic sometimes with my wife after a bad day we say to return to the Talia and open a kiosk of arancini jokes aside I could still return, but now we should be two to want most of the former university colleagues tell are abroad who in New York who in London I even met here in the Corridors of the University I didn't even know was in San Diego, but a colleague of mine resists a colleague of mine at the University of Salerno has published a study on breast cancer in the magazine Science Advances an important recognition I thought see C is hope

 It is like making the gas station if tomorrow cyclists have a 240 kilometer stop in the mountains need to make petrol so many proteins fresh products and above all carbohydrates who are the real fuel Antonio De Sarro comes from Asti is 35 years old and does not do the profession Petrol station but the chef of Vincenzo Nibali's team Bahrain Merida who is running the Giro D Italia has arrived after the apprenticeship in Italian and Australian French and Australian Italian starry restaurants and a series of high -level collaborations in cycling everything says he happened by chance His career began in a hotel in Turin but a few months later he packs his suitcases for Spain that year Valencia hosted the Sailboat America's Cup I had an uncle who lived there and asked me to reach him I pretended to think about those 30 35 seconds and then I flew to him learning the language and finding work in a well -known port restaurant was love at first sight In Valencia I immediately found myself from God it was not difficult to go from Asti to a large sunny university city alive and on the sea also for the work it seemed to me another world the rhythm was heavy because it is in the kitchen but the environment more livable and being The only Italian perhaps I was a bit benefited because they wanted to insert the pasta on the menu in Valencia I immediately found myself from God was not difficult to go from Asti to a large sunny university city alive and on the sea it did not immediately move the first years He spoken between Italy Spain and many other places I had just returned to Asti I was looking for work and I found by pure chance an open position from Guido so I entered the starred then he was 26 years old and from that moment he changed several restaurants from Record Alba Barolo but also Spain France and for a short period Australia in Italy I worked with great chefs including Antonino Cannavacciuol Or an unforgettable experience to amaze him I had put the most beautiful jacket I had was brown with golden strings he looks at me gives me one of his pats and tells me the chefs they dress in white of pats I took a lot from there from there On then Antonio's road was marked by incredible professional adventures even going to India to represent Italy was an international event and I really felt embarrassed because Valentino was there for high fashion and I for Italian cuisine after the stars suddenly Five years ago the two wheels arrived called me a colleague saying that they were looking for chefs for the tour de France at the time they were not elaborate dishes, you just had to make the pasta for all the teams that did not have a cook that is almost all the assignment was a month of three weeks of running and a first for the professionals I didn't want to go they had to really convince me king and force because I was afraid of losing what I had built in the starred as the first team tells me happened to me the motistar to which they often assigned me we were four chefs three colleagues were internal and I was external so I turned a little all the teams L Amaury Sport Organization ASSO L Organization of the Tour de France and other world competitions sent us to hotels to check the kitchens that the ingredients were fresh and the right pasta there I saw the worst part of my work there were cases in which I presented myself I asked the hoteliers to see the Kitchens and the products and they told me that it was everything ready so I had to make the cannavacciuolo of the situation and say I immediately throw the frozen pasta I think they hated me a lot from Cannavacciuolo I took many pats in the last five years Antonio has known champion as Alejandro Valverde and Peter Sagan and today for the second year of Kitchen Fila for Vincenzo Nibali and his team fortunately found the first year well the cook decides the champion in this case Nibali in practice the day of work type of the chef of cyclists lasts from 6 30 in the morning until ten in the evening But it doesn't spend all the time in the kitchen I prepare breakfast and while they are on a bike and the staff we anticipate them in the hotel where they will eat in the evening arrived there I speak with the chefs and organize the room then a check of the shopping and if something is missing They take supplies for dinner and the snack of the day after the most beautiful thing admits is the one you learn by working so I see a lot of kitchens places and products that otherwise I would not have the opportunity to know the nutritionist tells me which foods then I think I think how to cook them also based on what the territory offers two or three appetizers salad bruschetta fresh local products if we are in northern Spain I take good octopus and I do it in salad or in the galga if we are in the south I choose swordfish and so via Antonio works 150 days per year and for the rest of the time he lives in his beloved Valencia I did not plan to go abroad it happened by chance how Many of the beautiful occasions of my life and I was able to choose

 In Italy we are very abroad we think that elsewhere everything is better over time you understand that it is not so Elena Pedretti says it with thirteen years of experience in the United Kingdom arrived as a young veterinarian after having lived an Odyssey of funds disappeared to the research signed publications With the names of others Elena is now 45 years old and works for a clinic of a large veterinary group here economically is everything easier and there is meritocracy in Italy even if you have talent and desire to do your legs the history of Elena begins to Parma at the Veterinary Faculty works to pay for her studies and in spite of himself he knows the prevailing baronism Favoritismi Parenti harassment who arrived at the final exams, the idea of ??an experimental

feline fee of the human HIV in the project is interested in Professor Massimo Amadori who decides to involve it in his research still today I am surprised by the fact that he decided to entrust the project to me that I was a student without credentials and without any relative to guarantee for me the Research gets slippery several times first the pharmaceutical company that finances the project withdraws then the crazy cow case forcing the zooprophylactic institute of Brescia to divert the funds on the emergency finally part of the university funds mysteriously disappear in less than 24 hours, however, it tells the help, however Of the correlator and the Veterinary Hospital of Parma, the work goes through and becomes her degree thesis I did up and down to Italy to involve other doctors I paid off the travels working as a waitress our researchers arrive very high because in Italy They are formed very well but the problem is after reflecting us Elena years later, it finds that Italian universities are more than valid despite the many too many vices of form our researchers arrive very high because in Italy the problem is very well trained, if anything, it is after too many graduates for a few jobs and zero funds to the Thus research penalizes young people and ideas according to a report by the CNR l Italy spends in research and development L 1 33 of the GDP of which only the 40 comes from the government the rest is mainly financed by companies not profit and European funds the work of Elena is published in an international scientific magazine when I saw that there was my name I cried should be taken for granted but my correlator was also shocked years later I found my article in the London Veterinary Royal College library I got excited I finished my studies Find Jobs in a Veterinary Hospital in Turin begins with an internship then they ask her to stay I know D The lucky were lucky for many colleagues C was only infinite apprenticeship cleaned the tables and they could not touch anything a great plague of the Italian system explains Elena all abroad the work paid in experience or worse still in visibility simply does not exist indeed would be inconceivable despite the work Elena He feels limited I had a contract as a freelancer I was not hired as internal to the structure and with the salary I did not pay much to us much arrives in his life a Slovak companion who has a sister in London there was always the shadow of racism in the end we moved by mutual agreement for many reasons at the beginning looking for work in the north of the country everyone requires experience in the UK but if nobody hires you how to experience the impression of Elena is that Great Britain is yes a multicultural country but always with a veil of subtle racism in the air it happened that the people who came to the clinic turned On heels and came out when they understood that it was Italian here you cannot be too direct the customer is always right at times it seems that we must sell drugs more than cure thirteen years later it is difficult for her to trace a budget loves her job even if with respect to Italy It perceives as a more commercial that doctor sometimes seems that we must sell drugs more than cure here you cannot be too direct the customer is always right if he could say he would return to Italy in a beating of eyelashes but then thinks of taxes and the scarce prospects he would have to House at my age as I do to start thinking about thoughts me terrifies but my desire is to return and I hope to be able to do it in the United Kingdom admits it is all much easier from an economic point of view in three years I have been able to have a mortgage in Italy Not even selling a kidney here there is a mobility that does not exist with us even at sixty years you can change work of Italy She is missing sociability, the quality of life have a chat with the basic bartender, the real English is very wary of my English friends I count on the fingers of one hand Elena says to look sadly at the many graduates who leave to look for work abroad at the guys I always recommend having an experience out of leaving for a while the safety of the nest in Italy we should feel a little more European but then I always hope they come back because with some sense of guilt I think if we don't save it the Italy who will do it

In superiors he went to study for a year in the United States hosted by a family of strangers who returned to Lamezia Terme in Calabria for his maturity he already knew that he would start very early so after a degree in London two masters and professional qualification in New York Now Gaspare Chirillo has started at 25 the practiced who will lead him to become a lawyer specialized in corporate law also in the UK a two -year -old internship paid in one of the largest law firms in the world with a hiring rate that often touches 100 percent In England you invest a lot in practitioners are considered a wealth for example before starting the actual training contract all are obliged to follow a 6 -month practical course explains Gaspare if you are first selected by a law firm as in my case they are themselves to pay the course about 15 thousand trainee pounds ed. Who is not recruited Instead, he is forced to pay him his own pocket and to look for a study later because it is necessary here jurisprudence lasts only 3 years unlike Italy there are subjects as a criminal or civil procedure that are not really addressed to the university adds the course serves to fill these gaps but also teaches to collect information from customers to how to meet them in the right way to exercise on the rhetoric in court to the drafting of contracts an investment on the training aimed mostly at the hiring my study is structured in departments as a practitioner I will have to spend each Semester in a different department and in the end I will be able to apply for work in the most similar to my interests I was currently assigned to disputes in defense of the banks in the English capital but it costs a lot and Gaspare knows well fortunately the practiced is generally well paid The salary in Alcu ni cases can also reach 3 thousand pounds per month without counting free benefits such as medical insurance that on life the gym a psychologist always available clarifies your work is enhanced in every way I do not deny that it is one of the reasons that has me pushed to take this path abroad before leaving for London in fact his dream was to become a lawyer in a great forensic study of Milan but the economic crisis and the interests he has matured over time have made him change his mind if I had remained in Italy I could hardly have done all this without the concern of how to get to the end of the month for sure the next two years of practiced will be very hard but at least I have the certainty that my work will be recognized as it deserves from all points of view this does not mean that going To live 2 thousand kilometers away from home was an easy choice I really like to travel cone to be new people to be exposed to different cultures, however, let everything behind and get used to being any number in a big city like London at the beginning was heavy continuous Gaspare the first step I did it at high school when I spent a year in the United States in South Dakota thanks to an exchange program with interculture an experience that would not have been possible without the support of his family I owe a lot to my parents to my sister and my brother helped me on the economic level but above all on the emotional one since at 17 years I told them that I wanted to go overseas they never told me no despite being a huge step and it is precisely in the USA that Gaspare gained the decision once the high school is finished to leave for England was a natural passage also given the situation In Italy at that time he tells I arrived in London in 2013 to study jurisprudence a Lla Queen Mary University then I won a scholarship to attend a master's degree in American law in Virginia near Washington DC which allowed me to do the state exam as a lawyer in New York obtained the American qualification for which no one is necessary Internship has decided to take another year to deepen their studies in international commercial law in Cambridge and it is precisely during this second master who started looking for offers for the practiced in UK the double qualification will certainly open me more doors for example in London there are Many studies that work with American customers or have overseas offices and then it is also a personal satisfaction here are not many who obtain them both adds with an embarrassed smile to throw a shadow on his future, however, it is Brexit for now I am quiet because the workers and the workers students who are already overseas will be protected in every way the problem is that in the ults Mi two years has been lost a long time and nobody knows what will happen the greatest fear in all sectors is the loss of talents from other countries an earthquake that according to many will have serious repercussions on the economy in general is feared an escape of customers foreigners and it is not excluded that then there is the risk of making cuts to the staff even if in London it seems to be in a bubble it is difficult to meet someone who voted for the Leave despite the uncertainties Gaspare is still convinced that he does not want to return to Italy At least for now I have not escaped from my country as many do in many I had different ambitions I wanted to make a more slender university path that immediately pushed me into the world of work and then I was curious about the idea of ??studying a legal system other than ours as the Common Law in the coming years I will definitely stay in England I would not like to risk having to do all the apprenticeship again but when I have one Good working position I could decide to return as for many Italians abroad, in fact, the nostalgia of the house is often felt apart from the affections what is missing is also the typically Italian lifestyle the climate the food explains Gaspare and then I arrive from Calabria one land from which I learned hospitality respect the ambition of teachings that I try never to forget
 In Italy I was blocked by the bureaucracy here in Mexico I was reborn, starting from scratch the story of Matteo Sasso begins in 2013 when after 20 years as an electrician craftsman then specialized in the photovoltaic sector he decided to follow the Mexican partner Lydia for a short trip and never imagined That that could become their home she was a chef's intern in a restaurant in Isola della Scala in the province of Verona when we met after a while he invited me to Leon a city of almost two million inhabitants in his country one hour from the capital Matteo tells a few days trip to get to know the place that however became a transfer I was enough for me to look around where I was shooting a job offered a sign with the writing written like this Matteo captures the ball by deciding to leave the job In Bovolone always in the Veronese one activity that was fooling himself and he was no longer to his Maximants in Italy I felt suffocated in my small business I had not dependent collaborators so I was totally only to hit it is the different attitude towards the work but also towards what is new business here you can really open any activity but without all the Italian bureaucracy still explains to Telephone in Italy I felt suffocated in my small business I had non -dependent collaborators so I was totally only I had to deal with everything from the DIA denunciation of the start of the activity to the operational safety plan of security I had come to sick a stress that also blocked my swimming training training Master still says by justifying the reason for his definitive choice, the beginning has not been simple, he certainly earns less but everything is proportionate to the cost of living only cars cost in the same way with the prospect of losing perhaps the 20 years of Italian contributions Matthew decides to roll up The sleeves I started doing the agent of commercial always in photovoltaics a sector that in Mexico was developing only at the time here you do not need VAT number for example tells myself in the contract of large companies only as a technical consultant soon though though The contacts grow and with them also the will given the bureaucratic simplicity of settling on their own together with other Mexican boys we have put on a small company we fully follow the customer from the explanation of the product to the consultancy up to the contract with the service provider of the service and when I point out to a company that the customer is interested in expectations are minimal explains in three or four weeks you have set everything up when in Italy at least it takes three months in Italy we see the foreigner as a danger here welcome him with open arms and recognize his work next to it At the work of life in the electronic sector Matteo also manages to bring And ahead a little dream with her partner Lydia we opened a Mexican and Italian cuisine restaurant are only four tables but we have a amount of work such that we thought of moving under the house tells Matteo as well as the philosophy of photovoltaics suggests everything is rigorously green we produce We energy is as electrical as induction and eco -sustainable plates, for example, we make the differentiated and often recycle ourselves something a reality that in Mexico is being born only today in short less stress less bureaucracy and also the possibility of cutting space for another activity one Satisfaction that Matteo did not believe in Italy as much as possible to surprise him even the attitude of the Mexicans in Italy we see the foreigner as a danger here welcome him with open arms and recognize his work for this too Matteo is sure that he will not go back I will be able to put foot in Italy Just to finish the D ieci months that I miss when I reach the pension but my life is now the sun is my only worker and I am better

 I am the only one of my friends to have a house and keep myself alone with a freelance job in Italy what I could have done Alice Rugai is 26 years old and from two lives in Berlin he attended a master's degree in theatrical sciences works part time in a museum and translations from freelance the impact with Germany was not easy had to clash with employment centers that denied the benefits and suggested to her between the lines of returning home to Viareggio but the Italy had disappointed it just work in Black just work for free here I finally feel respected Alice has a graduate in foreign languages ??and literatures in Pisa with the specialization in Russian and English in Forte dei Marmi The Summer arrive many tourists I thought I had various job opportunities I did some jobs I taught Italian To the Russian children but most of the time I worked in black finished their studies Alice tried for a while to chase the dream of working in the theater wins a co ncorso for the preparation of one of his work but the project does not go to the port were not the money and they told us two weeks earlier from the staging we have been cards financed and we returned to the expenses with our forces by earning us even despite the baby The experience is successful from continuing the path of theater to work in culture in Italy you have to take into account many years of eternal apprenticeship and free work also in Germany the cultural environment is for privileged, however, after so much and so much apprenticeship at the end of the works is fine Passion but only accepts those who can afford it if you have to keep you simply do not do it in Germany the cultural environment is for privileged, however, after so much and so much apprenticeship at the end of the works for a period Alice worked as a teacher of Italian in the Sprar of Viareggio the thing It is more difficult to reconcile people with very different backgrounds there were those who had made the university but also Semi -illiterate people who were not used to an environment where adults are sitting on the desks to learn C were English -speaking and French -speaking but also those who knew how to write only in Arabic on the contrary, however, despite the few funds and difficulties Alice remember how a beautiful experience was A project that worked offered civic education courses and the boys were helped to find a house and work a boy managed to take his license while he was at the Sprar to find work as a road haulier C was those who jumped the lessons or spring but who wanted to integrate ce He put it entirely and later he returned to thank us now from Germany he follows the news of the news with concern then there was no talk of the sprars as now I was there because I felt the need to do something for migrants but it was a job in all respects more that goodism by reflecting in rear on that experience he believes that the reception system is an OC Failure to be needed by psychologists medical teachers interpreters in short, professionals left a little in the hands of the volunteers when you could create many jobs Alice wanted to make a master's degree in England where it had already been in Erasmus but the costs are prohibitive in Germany instead are free for Trying to integrate better and perfecting the language looks for a family in which to be a girl au pair you can feel constantly at work or constantly in a family depends on how they treat you in some way you are available 24 hours a day I was doing the laundry I was dealing with children and I had many responsibilities of meals all things that I would have done willingly if they had been shared instead the hostess read the magazines and asked me to go to fix the wardrobes in short, I felt a waitress so he changes family and even if things improve considerably he must clash with German bureaucracy to have benefits i.e. i Unemployment subsidies I had all the requirements to ask for the type B one I made a part time job and a German language course C1 to access the university the woman at the counter was truly rude told me we cannot pay everyone adding to return to Italy but I happened badly many compatriots have not had problems here in Germany under a certain threshold of earnings, taxes are not paid in Italy the VAT number would have been prohibitive now Alice started the Master All University is not that the German University is completely free of charge I am helped by the scholarship but the Semester Ticket for example includes transport that they cost a lot if I subtracted them from university fees it is as if I at the end I paid 30 euros to semester practically since I study savings now happily lived with an Italian boy and remains with various freelance activities in addition to work in a museum has put to use The knowledge of languages ??by working as a translator and cultural mediator The Italian Expat community in Berlin is in full growth tells Alice therefore the work never fails I can work as a freelance because in Germany the VAT number is free and under a certain threshold of earnings you do not do They pay taxes in Italy would have been prohibitive what she likes most of Berlin is the melting pot is a young city where many different cultures meet the society also improves from a human point of view you learn many things but above all dialogue and tolerance anyway He does not exclude to return to Italy we see what happens once finished my studies my boyfriend designs to stay I am open to the possibilities is not that I hate Italy we would miss it, however I am disappointed according to Alice the biggest problem is the failure to comply with the rights of workers Once they took me into trial in a restaurant for the summer season in the end I have due I uto to get them to make me pay two euros and fifty per hour in black but the salary is a right it should arrive at the end of the month and it is not enough to have to be discussed and struggle to have it just work in black and just work for free here I feel more respected here is
Since it has breakfast on Hollywood Boulevard and writes music for Netflix Giosu films no longer feels as often as often as much as she earns its latest project is called period of sentenses and is a short documentary on the stigmatization of menstruation in India that last February He also won the Oscar yes the question we encouraged it well and we tried sorry but how much they pay for similar works this is the difference between Italy and the United States when it comes to work because Giosu did not answer it is not said would mean devaluing Your profession whatever the figure the question rather should be you are happy to do what you do Giosu Greco was born in Polistena in Calabria is 29 years old and today he works in the world of the US Entertainment for years he studied saxophone because when he was great he wanted to be a jazzista This was the plan then thanks to a scholarship he set foot to the Berklee School of Music by Boston and here together with the books the practice came directly on the field C were ghostly recording studios so I put the saxophone on pause and I started producing emerging artists at night we could not have produced anything commercial in theory because in the He often uses practice wins on the rest the theoretical preparation that the American school gives you is less than that that ours offers you in music, however, they are very good at making you experience for us, for example, the end of the semester was not a theme or a thesis but a disc with a diploma in the giosu backpack leaves Boston and starts looking for a job he takes a ticket and flies to California produces independent singers before starting to compose for some short films thanks to Dan Romer a famous producer who had ended up to music to Writing songs for the movies was looking for an assistant I contacted it we talked and hired me was working on the video game Co Far Cry 5 and the TV series The Good Doctor asked me to write some songs like Additional Writer he liked everything and I have now started Giosu meets the directors and puts their emotions in music for documentaries and Netflix TV series as Innocent man and maniac but it is not an employee is freelance I do not have a fixed salary being paid regardless of how much you work it is an all -Italian dream here works as in a large company you work as much and you are paid in Italy instead too many times you aim for Fixed place a mirage with which they have deluded us for years a chimera especially if you want to be a musician or work in the sector cinema which is particularly complicated because there are no big investments and often our productions must rely on regional or European calls and funding by the way of Joshua questions answers instead what should do those who want to try this way you have to leave from it Alia because often they don't take you seriously and because there are neither money nor the people who write the music of the films is always the same young people do not work I would ever like to enter a multiplex and be able to choose between twenty films to 100 Italians and As soon as your freelance life is released is the bogeyman of many but the States seem to teach how you get away you understand it as soon as you get here you have to do everything to be the best you have to have personalities in Italy instead the idea of ??self made man does not exist and when in 2012 Giosu arrived in the United States did not clash with the myth of the American dream but has discovered a new way to face the school the work and its future
Fabio Cuttone became the citizen of the year, however, not in the city where Arluno was born and raised in the province of Milan even in the one where he studied for ten years Pavia Fabio at 39 years of age was voted as the most deserving citizen of 2018 in Tolosa at a Hundreds of kilometers from the Pyrenees in the French state won the competition promoted by Ladepeche Fr by the newspaper of Occitania, the region of which Toulouse is part here since 2014 Fabio the surgeon and adjusts the hearts of the children in the last year has occupied the Pages of the newspapers of the Alps for a very complex intervention that he carried out on a child of Armenian origin Alex suffering from a rare cardiac malformation that usually leaves little hopes of life just three days after birth, the team of the university pediatric hospital directed by Cuttone the has inserted a tube that communicates the aorta with the pulmonary artery to give it more oxygen but The most difficult operation was that of last April when Alex was seven months old I performed a conotronal rotation explains Fabio in simpler words I detached the aorta and the lung artery I rotated them 180 degrees and then I messed them in the correct position in the meantime The heart of the baby was arrested for about 150 minutes there are only twenty similar cases reported in the literature no one identical to this since he went from Italy Fabio to start using the irons every day in Pavia I was a surgeon without BELLI still admits with bitterness in my mouth I never operated a heart in five years of specialization I observed and it was enough the dissatisfaction grew day by day I did research and I wrote articles but they were always the usual to sign them your ideas do not count the biggest ones have Fear that they steal their place to turn you the wings do not give you responsibilities always make you feel a frustrat student Or he brought you the suitcases first for Caen in Normandy where he remained four years I knew an Italian professor who worked here I asked him if I could reach him to practice adults even if my dream was to become a pediatric cardiac surgeon finished this experience moved to London for a year through another French professor that he had met at a congress here I was able to study congenital pathologies in children in the meantime sent curriculum throughout Europe despite knowing that pediatric cardiac surgery places are very limited to the first hospital he replied was that was Of Toulouse and so Fabio put themselves at stake they proposed me a renewable year contract if I had been the height of expectations the following year I signed another one the third contract was two years now I am waiting to sign the time at the time indeterminate initially operated under the supervision of an older surgeon or then obtained everyone's trust began working independently, they entrust him with the most complex cases and proposes research projects I don't think that in Italy at my age all this would have been possible when we ask him if he wants to go home the answer It is perhaps but it is soon because our country is not yet ready for the change of pace if I come back I would not be satisfied with a lower role and frankly I see it hard if you don't have the title of professor you are nobody and so far I have not received any job proposal From Italy when it is not in the operating room Fabio goes on a mission I am a contact person I am a contact person for Tolosa di Chane de l Espoir a humanitarian organization that helps poor children to access education and care care for children from developing countries on site if possible or possible or We make them come here
When Elisa begins to answer the questions for the interview, immediately puts a clear thing not I don't want to be rhetorical to pass like the one that went abroad and now criticizes her country is only that here I am well I am an emigrant by choice And not only out of necessity and my research is free the biggest problem if you ask me it is precisely this in Italy you invest very little in research without counting the low salaries and in addition the progression in the university career not always based on the merit Elisa Vergari He is 33 years old and comes from a small village in the province of Pesaro Piandimeleto from his hamlet which has less than 100 inhabitants managed to get a doctorate to Oxford passing first for Germany then for Canada his last study was published in Nature Communications After the Triennale in Biotechnology in Urbino Elisa, he began looking for an abroad research position I read and learned that in Ge RMANANIA The so -called Nebenjob works for student student was paid unlike Italy I would have been able to pay me my studies and not having to depend on my parents anymore tells so he made a one -way ticket for Hamburg I got a scholarship Erasmus placement to go To make an internship at the Sigma Aldrich a famous multinational in the Life Sciences Elisa sector arrives in Germany without knowing the German my mentor at the Sigma Michael welcomed me with a fantastic welcome explaining for detail what my duties would have been.

was the ones to look for me through the recruiters I have a permanent contract since November 2017 with the paid holidays pay me three times more than how the same work paid about three hundred euros

colleagues of all nationalities here I have full freedom on how to promote the products and I have an excellent one Relationship with my colleagues of every nationality Daniele graduated in Cultural Heritage in Venice city where he grew up in 2003 L following he left for Lisbon with the Leonardo scholarship that allows internships in European companies formed to the Portuguese National Cineteca where yes specialized in the conservation of films and photographs I had found some opportunities I work in Lisbon and my father who He worked in the public administration advised me to stay abroad in reality I went back to being with my girlfriend of that time for three years he worked in Florence and then he moved to Bologna the city is culturally very lively I imagined finding work easily instead I have nothing Written to all the associations libraries archives, nothing ignored curricula was 2008 the crisis had begun to do the jobs tell of friends and colleagues left at home the only positive side is that a certain solidarity has been created between people to each other both among those like me who entered the labor market at that moment and between older people cut outside the certainty of the permanent place so as they arranged with various jobs and chores has decided to invest in the passion that cultivates the photograph since childhood I started at seven years following my father then I had some courses but I had not abandoned The idea of ??working in the world of cultural heritage therefore I made talks for a place as a cataloging in a prestigious city institution did not get the place but the words of the commission president remained in mind she is very good that it is still doing Here in Italy telling this episode adds to me to say it but my opinion is that not having studied in Bologna and having inhabited by other parts before I could not have worked in the Bolognese cultural elite despite Brexit I never worried about losing the job or having to have In the meantime, a friend of his had left a black job in Milan to be hired indefinitely in a London interior design studio despite the desire to remain in Italy the last professional disappointment convinced Daniele to cross the sleeve my first job is been in a photographic archive in Portsmouth then in the Devonsehire the last strip of land Before Cornwall he was there during the Brexit referendum, the Devon is a decidedly pro leave region with a great discontent towards European institutions especially among the oldest people who had nostalgia for a certain British greatur, however, I never worried about losing the job Or I had to return rather I had to reassure my parents because the media painted it like a catastrophe life in a city like Northampton 195 thousand inhabitants allows significant savings I have always kept out of London that has exorbitant costs often I move often for work with A train hour are in London and the highways are free Daniele is very satisfied

vlogs fashion or travel blogs just to make a handful of examples often happen to me to deal with food with All home delivery apps exploded Food Photography here many job opportunities have opened in Italy I don't know but remembering the years in which she worked in the Belpaese adds for me it was a cleaver to hear me say that I was doing a loser job or that I was choosy for many years I worked underpaid or even free often I had to chase the clever ones who did not pay me with the crisis I lost the big customers above all remember with bitterness the fact of having to ask for help from his parents to repay the tax authority here pays the 20th of taxes for both employee and freelance work to more to 80 thousand pounds is not subject to VAT when I had the part ta VAT in Italy the accountant told me that the five years of the subsidized game I concluded I would pay the 53 of taxes I was forced to close it now the job has taken another fold that I never happened to be unemployed on the contrary there have been some periods In which I could not be behind all the requests I had to the question what you lack most of Italy Daniele thinks about it on I don't know in the end perhaps the land of its roots Oristano I am carrying out a project to promote the Sardinian culture Our Sardinia with my photos and artistic performances The music of Claudio Sardu the reading of steps of D H Lawrence who wrote a sort of travel diary from Sardinia is a traveling project for Europe we will also go to Berlin and London I like to think I can be able to keep this link with Italy

very fashionable place full of beauties here is my dream is being able to be itinerant to live six months here in the Midlands and six months in Sardinia
Parties looking for a job, the emigrants also exist in Italy go to the north of the country towards Europe towards America leave the family as in the early twentieth century with an ideal cardboard suitcase here are some of their stories told in Valigiandicartone ilto Gail Com for months Perhaps years I always feel the same feeling of loss a university career or rather two interrupted in the illusion of being able to be able to simultaneously hold study and work in a city in central Italy rather distant from the no longer my taranto never had regrets for this only the real ones Most of the time in the lift shortly after greeting my parents tears who with the passage of time have become increasingly important sometimes silent swallowed in the soul and never digested my family became less and less numerous before the death of my brother and after a while also that of my father always in the same lift the Dolorous ritual always ready to return to that small provincial town that for twenty years has been hosting a small village halfway between Pesaro and Urbino that territory that seems like a century was now defined by the more red province are few to lose the opportunity to remember me that I am always a guest the same story when I open my interlocutor's mouth does not make discounts not an embarrassment part of the attack with the same cantilena but you are not from here I am me and you are not a warning the marquis of cricket the meaning for me It is the same for twenty years more or less with the passage of time more and more boria in my interlocutors never as I said embarrassment the cantilena is always around the punctual corner the boy the student in the meantime has become a man made his bones worked regularly the herself more or less of the contributions that have been paid to him over the years by the many respectable entrepreneurs, the same defined as yes, the right -thinking ones that in the years of the economic boom from small part -time farmers part time have become imported multinational realities, I work a lot of work and very black and a tax authorities that for years was satisfied with statements made on the presumption of income someone here loves to tell it without embarrassment Always the same who first attracted the internal migrations and at a later time those coming from the Balkan regions in the nineties today that manpower has set off on the family to be indebted to buy the house and send his children to school and at the university but still on the balls To many and it does not matter if they all vote together cheerfully Lega EN is de Mach are not from here and enough work force naturally considered of Serie B I have lived on my skin for years and the air that I breathe worsen day by day. Daily language is always more violent and aggressive sharp judgments often racists cynicism exagge Rato and widespread intolerance I worked for many years for a Venetian coop but I have never heard of the Negro with so much naturalness and ease here in my part we do to say naturally they hide behind the dialect seems that negr is a dialectal expression but who if if It cares about the dialect to me sucks anyway and this expression also offends me even if I have white skin and technically it does not concern me but it concerns me and it concerns us and should interest everyone but instead no a few days ago I made the umpteenth error not working regularly Since September I have accepted a job from the modern corporals 2 0 the interim working agencies have the power to decide who and when it can start working for 14 days I worked in administration at a small company in the area so as not to suffer reprisals of any kind I will not go down In detail among the blasphemies of the master as he loved to define himself and the verbal offenses of the ti Po you don't know how to make a C or you are a pack of touches you move here only to waste time and much more never a sip of water only continuous humiliations then one day the last to be precise a colleague younger than me bursts it all becomes red in the face e He goes quickly in the locker room he probably cries to him was only granted only to hang the anger had not chosen with two children returned to the location and continued to work with red eyes and his head is probably also repeated and I have been repeating myself for days I would have done the same but I am lucky I have no children I went away at the end of the morning of the morning to anything it was served to motivate my reasons primarily to the wife Padroncina the head of the department I believe in secundis to the powerful corporal result of the almost 90 hours made I had The order to introduce myself to the station at least 40 minutes before compared to the agreed time I was paid only 77 on the res to is tip for my master but who cares like a modern slave I paid for the price to free myself from that nightmare the system now requires to present the electronic resignation that have a cost between 15 and 20 euros if it is a union like As a national convention otherwise if you are familiar with the PC and you have a device pin with the INPS or other accredited body you can avoid pouring the offices to those who have turned your shoulders just those unions that have been hiding your head in the sand for years Those who are now unable to defend the workers too busy to defend their status quo when it is good and yes because when it goes wrong they are on vacation at the expense of the same union acronyms that look at each other well to report such abuses, luckily those friends arrive those who have had the courage to pack and move to London are sincere you will be considered a foreigner still warn but with me this warns timento does not constitute a deterrent, however, they consider me a foreigner also in Italy in the village between Pesaro and Urbino so foreign, mine are not paranoia or inferiority complexes anyone can treat you as a foreigner to make you feel a foreigner I make the plane ticket and I prepare mentally starting I spent weeks months to send and deliver curriculum around a few answers the most ridiculous that of a corporal who contacts me on the phone to tell me come to visit me in theatesty I propose a job in production you indulge your pill it means I make you do the worker I'm fine I reply I call her in the morning to make her support the online course on safety promises but the next day the call does not arrive and I call it I no longer have the possibility of making courses the proposal that I made yesterday automatically cancels short size for the end of the History I had almost forgotten this grotesque experience I already have stam Pato the ticket for London I have not yet warned any of this choice I feel a little shame I am a traditionalist or as he loved to call me my wife shortly after knowing me obviously in the workplace you are a man of other times told me with affection I leave now so Everything when I probably should insist persevere what awaits me probably will be the best that I happened to justify myself but I can't feel nostalgia for my house and what's my home I have only a bitter certainty I can't even consider myself a brain on the run Raimondo Riondino
The brain drain, that is, the escape of brains that is not compensated by inputs of qualified personnel is a problem of Eurozone in particular of the countries of Southern Europe that in the last ten years have emptied of talents and skills and the picture of Italy highlights a strongly situation Critics our country loses highly qualified labor that escapes abroad to find a job while attracting immigrants with skills generally scarce between 2007 and 2017 the country has undergone a real brain drain a brain escape with a clear loss of about 130 thousand people highly qualified at the same time, a clear immigration of the two lower preparation classes to underline it are Cinzia Alcidi and Daniel Gros of the Ceps Think Tank based in Brussels in the EU Mobile Workers study in Challenge to Public Finance presented today during the informal Ecofin in Bucharest the picture that emerges explains CEPS is that the states Southern members of the Eurozone have undergone a clear emigration of highly qualified citizens for the large countries in which these people go like Germany and the United Kingdom have recorded a clear increase in the levels of education for France has not been almost any clear variation To win the war of talents confirms CEPS was the United Kingdom given that the increase in its population has been strongly moved to European citizens with high schooling the net profit in graduates amounts to over 800 thousand in ten years four times so much 200 thousand People at the bottom of the skills of skills also Greece and Spain have mainly lost highly qualified staff such as Italy for Ceps this suggests that Brain Drain could emerge as a problem within the eurozone although for the moment the magnitude of the phenomenon remains limited
Bari Paris return the story of Davide Giardino is not that of a brain on the run but of a young thirty -year -old from Bari who found work abroad in France at the European Space Agency Esa David, however, has never forgotten his hometown Bari where he from Some time collaborates with a company in the aerospace sector and it is he who four years ago brought to the Apulian capital of Tedx a show conference format dedicated to the scientific cultural and academic world after graduating in law the idea of ??becoming a lawyer who is not very passionate Davide who chooses another road in 2010 in Italy C were about 220 thousand lawyers and between 95 and 2017 the number of members to the order grew from 192 then I decided to write a thesis in international law on the control of migratory flows in the Mediterranean already theme of Great topicality then with a scholarship of the University of Bari I did a research period in ST Rasburg to the European Court of Men's Rights a fundamental experience for his training followed by a Master in International Relations to the Italian Society for the Sioi International Organization in Rome, an entity not for profit that has been operating since 1944 under the supervision of the Ministry of Affairs Foreign mine was a tiring path tells but also lucky until twenty years ago studying jurisprudence the natural outlet were legal careers today is not always the case even if there has not been a radical change and schools and universities still struggle to form people in able to respond to the needs of the job market for a few months Davide has been working with an Apulian company based in Bari with which he carries out activities with the ESA European space agency we started developing some projects both in the space sector and in others throughout Italy And in Puglia where big investments are recently made in the septum King, just think of Virgin Galactic who has launched a project on suborbital flights and space tourism in our region a life that is divided between Bari and Paris to develop complex issues such as the fourth era of the space intended to revolutionize not only the industry but also life Of all of us his training and working path was intertwined with his passions, this led him to become the organizer of Tedx Bari four years ago he tells while I went from one internship to another I decided to organize the Tedx conference an independent event in Bari Born under Licenza Ted acronym for Entertainment and Design Technology, the Conference was born in America in 1984 to encourage the circulation of ideas that deserved to be widespread over the years several Nobel prizes have been the founder of Wikipedia and those of Google and many other illustrious speakers today the TED is the largest worldwide sharing platform with a cana YouTube with over 1 Emiliard of views and almost 10 million members and thanks to Davide's work every year in Bari you can participate in the convention in the last four years thanks to a cultural association founded with friends and young colleagues we managed to bring to Bari on stage of the Petruzzelli Theater relevant personalities such as the astronaut Luca Parmitano Vinicio Capossela or the activist against female genital mutilations mentioned by Time Jaha Dukureh before leaving Italy in 2016 Davide had made several experiences abroad in Peru as a volunteer for a project in a family home Washington DC to do research in the context of the management of migratory flows for an NGO up to the landing in Paris I do not like the definition of brains to escape first of all because it creates a rift between those who have the opportunity to have experiences abroad and who I do not believe that the question must be framed by a different perspective and taking into account that And we often refer to a certain social class that has the opportunity to move but there is also a part of the population that does not have this opportunity in a context where there is no form of welfare if not a few electoral tips that from time to time and with Different names is distributed the only way to actually access certain opportunities it is to resort to the help of their families by imposing them and then what our country should do to not lose its talents according to David should start from the education are not able to give an answer precise explains given the complexity of the world in which we live it is essential to consider policies not only at national level, however, it seems clear to me that in the last thirty years a ruling class has failed or whatever it also approaches the idea of ??the latter I believe that the choices which will be made on the education on school in particular can be Det Herminants in one direction or other
 In Italy I often found myself evaluated by bureaucrats without skills I could also coexist with precariousness in times of crisis my salary was not bad but the context had become unbearable Tiziano Romanelli is from Florence and is 44 years old left Italy in September of 2016 once returned from the honeymoon after Ireland today lives and works in Germany in Frankfurt together with his wife I finally feel valued at the salary is double the benefits many and for now it is a door that closed when he was 30 years old He had moved for work to Milan and there remained for 7 years until in 2012 he leaves the company follow three years of precariousness and lack of meritocracy Titian understood that his future was abroad in April 2016 when he received the notification of the layoffs on the day of the 41st birthday the company I worked for essentially no longer wanted to invest in research and innovation From there he remembers the departure for Dublin as they welcomed me as a head of state smiles the interview did not spend more than three days for the offer in Ireland were almost flattered to help Italians integrate the day of work into their company Irish was quiet systematic organized and in Germany it is also better after 23 months in Ireland Tiziano and his wife move to Darmstadt 30 kilometers from Frankfurt the biggest difficulty was to find a accommodation explains the search for the house is complex especially because the market offers Little compared to the question then there is the language the German that my wife and I did not know at all at the time of the transfer the day of Irish work was quiet systematic arrival with a relaxing walk quiet road public green and no noise of clacson common cuisine in Ambient Ambiente Ambiente Average Low Age Car Ichi of work not excessive showers for those who come by bike or those who make a race on the lunch break on Wednesday fixed appointment with the soccer on Friday happened to relax in front of a guinness when they leave the truth more than one smile Tiziano in Germany the Things go better, we are twenty in the office all engineers little bureaucracy we work in full efficiency both in Ireland and in Germany the card is not stamping there is a lot of availability and flexibility explains Titian and it also happens that you can work on the weekend to respect a deadline But the hours more worked even if not recorded can be taken as permits differences Titian is convinced of his choice I know colleagues who broaden their arms and accept this state of things others like me beat the fists on the table until then burst and send everyone to That country even if then to that country you decide to go there when you realize that you can't change King nothing in Italy cultural storage with a stagnant debate on migrants and safety at abroad are very attentive to the satisfaction of the worker in Italy I have witnessed and lived lowness of all kinds of mobly colleagues if deemed in exubber obliged to finish the work the day before they went to Continue layoffs what it means to be Italian for an emigrated couple Skype certainly reduces distances but sometimes you feel the nostalgia for people and roots Titian is angry for the cultural embarrassment to which with a stagnant debate concentrated on migrants and safety in Germany the arrival with a stagnant debate Foreigners have created jobs related to language and integration courses in Italy is praised to the return of the Duce and we have boasted of posting on social networks of bulldozers and evictions all this continues while the industries close or are relocated the indignation is mixed to resignation when he thinks or that I trained professionally in companies that in the 90s represented one of the main centers in the world for the development of telecommunications today of that technological heritage remains very little to the appeals to politics to save the research have fallen into the void to return for now the future is In Germany in Italy we form appreciated graduates and researchers but all the resources spent to ensure a high education quality must be wasted if many go to work in foreign companies if no administrator is concerned with this paradox so it can be done if you don't leave
that of the welcome and to do something to help and promote women is a ball that Sarah Grimaldi 35 year old Romana has always had in the head before he did it with the Orient Experience restaurant open in Venice with two members and also managed with migrants and refugees and then With El Caf de Las Mujeres the coffee of women inaugurated last February in Santiago in Chile a magical and unique place made and designed to give space to female entrepreneurship across the board a place for women but also open to men the idea came to her One morning in a period of his life in which he was having to reconstruct everything but once the things were decided in the right direction and two other Brooke members 34 year old American and 37 -year -old Fernanda Chilean my experience with the experience with the Restaurant in Venice ended after 15 years for personal reasons tells Sarah I had a friend in Chile and I went to visit him for a few months in 2017 Then I returned to Italy I found myself in the condition of having to reinvent a life so goes to Florence to teach skating on the Sport ice that had practiced competitive level in youth there he also knows Brooke also dependent on the skating center that becomes his great friend I miss the My affections but not so much Italy all seemed angry and a little sad I missed Chile one day one day I came out of the mind the coffee project I chose Chile because there was this friend who became my boyfriend for a period and above all because c He was a very strong feminist movement so in a couple of months he sells his share of the restaurant in Venice and leaves for Santiago with this dream shortly after having arrived there Brooke from Italy to tell her that she also wants to participate in the project by investing her savings and a They joined Fernanda that Sarah had known on her first trip to Chile and which is now also his Coinquilin To each of us has a role in the coffee explains Sarah I take care of organizing events to contact entrepreneurs and promote initiatives on social media broke is our operating arm works at the counter and adjust everything Fernanda instead deals with the accounting part And financial the idea underlying women's coffee is to give space to women and their initiatives from the suppliers of food and drinks for the restaurant up to the artists every month two entrepreneurs are presented who with their products can join the Menu or are presented to customers there is those who make sweets who jam cereals coffee or natural body products also the menu is all female except for the chef who is a Venezuelan boy is designed for women and each dish has the name of A writer of a poet and other important women for the path of life of coffee creators we want to talk about feminism But not in a precise fundamentalist way Sarah at some point had to specify that the place was also open to men we saw them wandering out without having the courage to enter even if the project has recently had a good response despite Chile is a country Still very male chauvinist, perhaps they take us into consideration in a different way because we are foreign and we come from outside the Sarah continues, however, many proposals of women and entrepreneurs who want to collaborate with us are coming and presenting their initiatives are also organizing poetry and sewn writing courses e On how to deal with violence, the answer seems good to me we also have a space dedicated to the presentation of the books and from which you can take books on loan, the idea is to make Latin American writers and poets known little known at a certain point we had to specify that the local was also open to men there V We were wandering out without having the courage to enter for a year now in Chile Sarah is enthusiastic about his experience to the other head of the world Santiago is a living city that offers many opportunities certainly admits my affections but not so much Italy when I returned For the Christmas holidays it was strong enough they all seemed angry and a little sad I missed Chile here I wake up in the morning and I feel happy and when I am sad I go to the ocean when I will not feel more well then who knows I will watch Elsewhere but I don't know if it will be Italy my concept of home has changed in any place any place makes me feel or allows the realization of my dreams automatically becomes my home
 I ran away from Rome to find an environment that worked like me Alberto Forte 32 years old lives in Lausanne where he specialized in psychiatry and is completing a doctorate of research in neuroscience his degree in medicine, however, he took it in Italy at Sapienza is actually from When I was 18 years old that something inside me pushed me to leave tells but a little out of laziness a little for fear I did the university where I was born and raised when during my studies I understood that I wanted to be a researcher to flee abroad it became an obligation In particular, I wanted to move to Austria or Switzerland where it is possible to specialize and at the same time start the doctorate unlike us so after sending curriculum to the universities of all of Europe starts for Lausanne where she has lived for seven years by alternating patients in the studio with The research activity deals above all of the deficit of the attention disorder from post -traumatic stress and patients with high intellectual potential with an intelligence quotient greater than 120 unfortunately many Romans resemble their lazy and sedentary caricatures in the midst of the Alps, he has found the perfect professional environment for his own fussy and tireless character only at work, but he jokes in life private I am a mess I lose and break everything but when I have dead or projects at stake, I become a car for this I could no longer stay in Rome where it is impossible to plan anything because there is no respect for the times of the time and the movements of others I was becoming Unfortunately, Matto many Romans resemble their lazy and sedentary caricatures in his city, he said he never managed to imagine a future I felt like in a decadent village most of the people I met I do not say all but at least 8 out of 10 were unable to Long -term reasoning from a neolaurea You are treated with enough you have to demonstrate everything and almost always you are forced to drain to find your place in Switzerland is all different as soon as I arrived I was nobody but whoever gave me of her called me doctor and respect me and beating the feet of others in the university environment Not only is it not necessary but it is malvunic to the beginning also in Lausanne I tried to show me in any way because I was used to doing it in Rome when my superiors were noticed I was told to stop because there was no need my place there I had and for them I was the same as the other colleagues the comparison between Rome and Lausanne is also merciless in other aspects here I work in a unique environment a rare pearl tells Alberto we are on the shore of the lake surrounded by the mountains in buildings designed by the best architects, the university offers courses free in more than 400 sports disciplines, the meaning is taking care of researchers and students as people not Only as workers every day are dozens of conferences and round tables are a place of modernity and culture, however, it is also true that the life of a young Swiss student can be very stressful the university system here does not stand delays if you fail a two exam Sometimes you are out of the first year of superiors, the boys accumulate a score that will decide their admission to universities this is perhaps the aspect that I like less because I don't think it is right to undergo this pressure the boys and it is not the only defect in Switzerland I must admit that as far as I have been here for seven years I have never felt at home I have remained a well -integrated foreigner certainly but always one who comes from outside with all the labors of the case at the same time, however, I could not return to Italy especially in Rome every time I go back even for short periods, ten minutes of traffic on the fitting is enough to make me pass the desire may perhaps Living in some small village in Tuscany or Piedmont would be a less traumatic change, the university system here cannot stand delays if you fail an exam twice you are outside this is what I like least in Lausanne especially Alberto warned a trust that in Italy hardly reserves the estimate of my superiors to young doctors of his age has allowed me to progress from a professional point of view three times more quickly than I would have done in Italy if I had remained in Rome during the specialist I would have had an academic contract without contributions At a fixed term and with a fixed salary here there is no specialization as we understand it but just after graduation we are considered doctors in all respects and you start your career with the contributions paid indeterminate to the fourth year of specialist I became responsible for a clinic Specialized in post -traumatic stress disorder something unthinkable for Italy here there is no snobbery or sufficiency towards those who are young and are still forming for this concludes cannot imagine returning to what you still feel your own home like it Lausanne because it is a small city but it feels great Rome is the opposite is large and beautiful but the mentality is that of a village here I found my balance
 In Italy there are no conditions of minimal dignity for a new architect without friends or relatives in the Agnese Dorase sector has recently been born and raised in Pineto in the province of Teramo where she graduated nine years ago is an architect and He deals with projects for mono and multi -family homes since 2012 has lived and works in Switzerland in Nyon between Geneva and Lausanne immediately hired with a permanent contract earns 6500 francs per month about 6 thousand euros here the cost of living is very high more than two thousand Franchi leaves only for the rent tells us but I am completely independent and I can make a dignified life without the anguish of how to get to the end of the month Agnese felt forced to emigrate I make an autobiographical example the year in which I graduated I participated At a competition with a group of other students and recent graduates we worked for a whole month and night for Roman architects and ABB We have won the 50 thousand euro call but there was not even a reimbursement of symbolic expenses a practice that is recurring in our disappointed area of ??Agnese started for Germany destination Monaco where I explained I worked for a year I invoiced a small salary as a freelancer who It allowed me to be economically autonomous as well as making a very interesting training experience and transparency and correctness are incredible a year later trying to return to Italy I looked for work both as a freelancer and employed in the first case the problem is to find customers when you are not The daughter of someone who works or worked already in the sector and then even once found it is not easy to be able to get paid in the second case the possibilities are few and in the talks I had they have told me all of a trial period that translated means work for free on the pretext of forming the young moral architects of the fairy tale I have s Gobbed a year without being paid and so in 2012 he moved definitively Swiss destination where he immediately finds work now Agnese is in an architectural and urban planning office that creates and drawing innovative life spaces a private company in which there are many under 40 contracts a indefinite period and a dizzying compensation compared to Italian standards even if to eat a pizza outside you have to take into account the equivalent in francs of 20 25 euros and while seeing that rivalry meanness mobbing and even stalking are dynamic unfortunately of the human being Agnese underlines that Swiss laws provide for the employer's duty to ensure the psychophysical well -being of employees therefore in cases where these episodes occur we workers we are protected by the attending physician by the unemployment system and in the most serious cases from justice and so far it has seen that the Welfare works the Insurance One accidents pays the employer the health worker is charged to my charge and payments for retirement and motherhood is mandatory are deducted from the salary while the thirteenth is variable and usually negotiates twelve or thirteen monthly can be but always in the heart I miss people the family and friends the mentality in social relationships the culture and also the fact of being able to buy a house or open my business that is extremely difficult in Switzerland one day Agnese wants to go home but only at some conditions if I find a job which allows me to live well or an exciting project such as renewing an old country farmhouse to launch a production activity
 When I saw New York for the first time I realized that this would be the country where I wanted to live Ugo Brisolese is a 32 -year -old from Catania who feels American and after taking a three -year degree in classical letters in Catania he decided to move to the United States where he is PhD student in Italians at the University of Wisconsin I realize that it is strange for a graduate in classical letters to love a country as avant -garde as the USA but I could almost say that it is as if I were born in America and I saw Italy as a beautiful country in which to spend the holidays not to live us unlike the many young people forced to leave Ugo his way he chose it I have a sort of visceral and unconditional love for the United States this does not mean that everything is perfect indeed the problem of weapons the weapons Violence The poverty of some social bands I ghettos the drug l alcohol l obesity racism healthy are all parts soc questions I saw the agenda but my house is here and I hope it is forever when four years ago decided to move, however, his knowledge of the American language and culture were to be refined I rolled up my sleeves tells me ready to embark in a Very difficult life experience extremely demanding all uphill started improving the language in San Francisco then studied a year close to New York where he attended a university language course to get the cards in view of the doctorate the places for the PHD Here are very few explains but in my field it was particularly difficult because the doctorate in Italians is offered only by the best universities of the country who studies engineering or computer science instead can also focus on less prestigious universities with good possibilities to enter Ugo has been admitted by three universities And in the end he chose to attend the University of Wisconsin in Madison My program here is one of the best in the country and the University of Wisconsin is considered among the 25 best in the world rather than the habits of Catania is missing the sun as well as the affections here is all ordered c is a lot of green the bureaucracy is efficient The only problem is the intense cold of winter you get 25 degrees apart from this I find myself very well at the university many professors are Italian but follow the American method so much study and I would say zero free time than Italy the approach is more structured here you read here In full all the works, even the secondary ones of all Italian literature with attached critical bibliography, we read a lot and write a lot to prepare for the academic world after the end of the doctorate but the difference can also be seen in the classroom in Italy. Students do what they want Here when I keep a lesson the students are silent put the mobile phone away and no copy AG The exams Ugo dreams of staying in this area and aspires to become a university professor has clear ideas even if his doctorate has just begun I decided the historical period but not yet the exact subject my thesis will probably be on Sicilian authors of the nineteenth or twentieth centuries Like Verga Pirandello or both for his country he tries a healthy melancholy I love Italy especially I love Rome as I love many other Italian cities with their millennial culture I certainly lack but I would not know how to define well what kind of lack is luckily for the moment I don't weighs and then here are the best universities in the world where I hope to find work as a professor one day
The greatest luxury for Sara Ferrari is to have a coffee at the bar while waiting for her little girls to come out of the dance lesson to carve out an hour to have a chat with the people of the place

 In Germany I am fine and I think I can make my dreams come true, the salaries are more than double compared to Italy and the cost of the lowest life and something that struck me is that during the interview they ask the worker that salary expect science fiction compared to the Italian reality asked me how much I thought I appropriate to be paid and when I was hired they respected my request Alessandro Ivicoli 36 year old graduate in computer science worked in the city where Trento was born but he was not satisfied so he chose to leave I brave no I think more needed courage to remain in Italy that is based on a patient patient system and not meritocratic was a pondered and meditated choice today Alessandro lives in Oldenburg in Lower Saxony and deals with the computer programming of the missile launching platforms of military ships there Curious thing explains that it was not me who is looking for this job But the opposite the company he hired me found me on LinkedIn attracted not so much from my professional curriculum as from my hobby the chess I created an artificial intelligence for this game that caught the interest of the company and was the first time That this item in the curriculum put between the hobbies was decisive to find work to tell the truth in Germany this detail has aroused interest in all job interviews while in Italy no one has ever considered him as many of his peers graduates in Italy has lived for years you are exactly working with precarious contracts, I survived VAT for three years like freelance explains Alexander but not being a pure entrepreneur I spent my days at home looking for customers the economic situation worsened and I was on the hem of the exhaustion here the companies consider training an investment and professional growth translates into Increase in the salary for this decides to return to looking for work as a programmer in a computer company finds it and I start to breathe a little is hired with a fixed -term contract but at that time I lived and immediately says a bit the whole rotten of the Italy system And at work I continued to not have satisfactions he feels suffocated crushed between a clientele system he suffers and a ability to grow that feels denied every day of work that passes over time things did not improve at all, indeed I explain myself I was accumulating a certain negativity I did not live well in that context and I believe that when you do not accept a situation the only way out is to take one's life in hand and become protagonists so I did in December 2016 Alessandro decides to leave in Germany for two reasons It is a meritocratic country where in my field finding work is very simple and for two years to q Ueast part after the Brexit referendum many start -ups have moved from London to Berlin by feeding a labor market already very slender in itself Alessandro chooses Berlin as the first point of arrival first hurry up all the bureaucratic tasks registry in account in the subscription bank For public transport since I am in Germany, Alessandro has never touched a car again and immediately afterwards he immerses in the study of the language my idea of ??postponing the search for work to better study the German proved to be a good strategy in the work interviews And in Germany I made more than two months than I made in Italy throughout my life this choice was very appreciated because it highlighted my will to establish myself in Germany finding the house is more difficult for finding a job you need solid guarantees A couple of months pass and Alessandro begins to get away well with the German so translates his curriculum and update At his LinkedIn profile in German and English after three months I was already working he moved from Berlin to Oldenburg where he is hired for the company for which he still works excellent salary but above all prospects for professional growth huge is the company that is concerned with forming you over time which provides for specific growth paths and plans them so that the worker can reach adequate skills, the company considers it an investment and professional growth translates completely automatically into a progressive increase in the salary paradoxically finding a house in Germany is revealed much more difficult that finding a job need months and you have to give solid guarantees to return to Italy Alessandro does not think about it but does not say it with the arrogance of Italy I say the family are missing friends the dance courses that are my passion but the my country was unable to guarantee me what I want for me and my children
Tens of thousands of euros to be returned to the Revenue Agency despite a law assured a discount on taxes once he returned to Italy thirteen scientists and researchers returned from foreign countries with the promise of important tax breaks by the State sent a letter to the deputy minister of the Lorenzo FioMonti education in which they denounce the situation to report it is Republic for some of us write the requests for reimbursement and sanctions could exceed 100 thousand euros destroying the home and family projects built with sacrifice over the years write the rule that ensured the tax discount is the Law Decree 78 2010 which reduced the tax base to 10 but in recent months the Revenue Agency has started to carry out tests on various researchers who had enjoyed that rule according to the tax administration to benefit from it was needed to register for the registry of Italians residing abroad AireDespite the same Revenue Agency, responding in 2010 to the question of a taxpayer had deemed the tax residence in the foreign country and the brains that were not registered in the Aire but had benefited from the norm, the tax authorities asks to pay the account to Michele De Gennaro expert engineer In the car with reduced carbon dioxide emissions that then decided to return abroad he still specifies Repubblica was asked to pay a 20 998 21 euro account for Andrea Listori instead the figure reaches almost 45 thousand and yet in 2012 when I returned from Great Britain I received The letter of acceptance of the Revenue Agency explains to the newspaper, the expert of new materials for solar panels at the University of Salento in the letter, researchers also denounce the strategy in the scattered order of the tax agencies, some explain have applied the standard on the return of workers rather than the one on the return of the brains Others have requested to pay the complete sum, albeit recognizing non -punishment and therefore canceling the penalties but there are also agencies that require Irpef interests and full penalties
 In Italy I thought I ended up depressed and without a penny is 2011 when Sara Lucchetti Romana born in 1987 feels tired and without expectations a contradiction at 24 years old life certainly does not flow easy for her to come from a poor family and with health problems explains even That three -year degree in linguistic and cultural mediation conquered thanks to a scholarship seems to open promising opportunities to her Sara in fact continues to hatch between precarious uses and underpaid cleaning in a bed and breakfast bartender waitress until in 2011 at 24 he decides that It can more want to discover a new life away from Italy I decided to leave for several reasons I wanted to speak English well because despite I had studied for years I had no mastery of the language and I wanted to change my life to escape to become independent and have different experiences I wanted to go the most far away as possible the Australia in my head was a land if Lvaggia and exotic so I chose him the most difficult aspect was to say it at home in particular to the sick dad my father did not want my mom to leave instead he was happy for me while my older brother was frightened because I was alone according to him I was crazy To go to a place so far and without knowing anyone I started from humble positions but once the tongue has been masked the language, managerial roles at the beginning the plans are clear Sara wants to remain only six months to work a rent that is able to pay the first Days sleeping on the friend of the friend of a friend who hosts her I had three thousand euros aside to have the shoulders covered for a while but after just three days in Melbourne Sara already has a job like bartender in a restaurant after a week finds accommodation and three weeks later he decides he wants to stay to live there I asked my ex -boyfriend with whom I was two years to reach me but he was not interested in Australia therefore we decided to leave us Sara looks at the future with his work with his job is well paid and there are real possibilities to go up grade I started from humble positions but once the tongue has been master, they climbed managerial roles I also managed an artisan ice cream shop for the First 5 months from the opening and now it is one of the most famous in Melbourne then I found a sponsor in an Italian restaurant that allowed me to remain and obtain the residence the comparison with Italy from the point of view of earnings is merciless the cost of the life is more or less the same but the average salaries are three or four times higher so you can live comfortably and if you want if you prove that you are able you can work in any sector and so it is 2017 when Sara changes again and designs again a totally different job thanks to some friends who push her to try a yoga lesson with them for her the meeting with the discipline is A love at first sight when I saw that I made progress quickly and made me feel good became my drug from twice a week I started practicing it 5 or 6 days a week my teacher continued to tell me how much I was brought and asked me if I had ever thought To take a teacher course, she pushed me to realize that I was a natural talent and so my training began the worst thing is the distance so after 400 hours of the course between Melbourne and Ubud in nearby Bali Sara became a yoga teacher and Today he explains the asana to young and old as his only job I finally do not do a job that does not give me spiritually gratties the money does not count if you are not happy not only has he found a new guy who like her loves Australia and yoga and ad April will finally be able to ask citizenship but it is not all gold what I miss our traditions, I sometimes miss my city Rome and above all my hooks There is the worst thing is the distance we are so far away that everything seems to be missing even more as if that were not enough, the Australians are not honestly welcoming samples our culture is richer and more welcoming the Italians as soon as they arrive in Australia would like to avoid the Other Italians then end up creating an Italian community here too and I did exactly so in short on the working level, Australia wins on Italy but as regards interpersonal relationships, Italy has the best even if for now she does not intend to change the hemisphere but never say never if I opened a yoga study in Italy I would return to Sara Lucchetti is among the Italians abroad that appear in the documentary Italy farewell I will not return

 When I left for the United States I was a bit frightened but it is normal for such an important experience once I arrived in Boston, but I didn't even have time to be afraid the rhythms were very fast and I had to learn everything quickly for four years Giuseppe Lofano 32 years old from Conversano in the province of Bari lives in the States and is a researcher after a period spent in Boston for less than a year he has been working in Washington D for a pharmaceutical multinational I deal with the development of new vaccines offering my scientific support on internal research projects and development and helping to evaluate external business opportunities for the Company a job of great responsibility that Giuseppe has tried since the years following the degree to search in Italy without having a degree in Biotechnologies Pharmaceutical Biotechnology from the La Sapienza University of Rome has made LESMUS in Paris in Paris It was a fantastic experience was the first time I lived abroad I did not know where to start also because I was only 21 years old I remember that after ten days I could not find a house I decided to let it lose and return but I remained I worked I had fun I learned so much the experience in Paris becomes fundamental for Giuseppe at the point That after graduation he thinks of being a doctorate abroad, I was passionate about immunology applied to vaccines so I looked for the best place for the doctorate but he discovered that one of the most prestigious vaccinology institutes in the world was in Italy in Siena I asked question and I was Accepted during the doctorate Giuseppe studies the mechanism of action of vaccines trying to understand why some are more powerful than others I discovered that one of the most prestigious vaccinology institutes in the world was in Italy in Siena I asked for question and I was accepted the studies arrives the studies arrives moment to work after the doctorate tells I started looking for work in Italy without particular success but one day at the end of a conference I happened to talk about the results of my research to some professors of the Harvard Medical School in Boston one of the most important universities in the world, these were very interested and offered me the opportunity to reach them for Continuing my searches about vaccines and so Giuseppe enters a team of researchers who are trying to develop a vaccine against the HIV was a dream that came true it seemed to me the best occasion of the world but I was very fought because I wanted to stay in Italy were the My parents to encourage me to leave I will never thank them enough for supporting me in finding my way to take care of HIV to Harvard does not betray expectations and becomes one of the most formative experiences for the young Apulian researcher I remember that one morning I had gone to the hospital to collect of the champions to be analyzed while I was waiting for a colleague I met patients in the waiting room and we started chatting I explained to them that I dealt with science that I studied the immune system of some patients infected with HIV and that with my data I helped to draw the vaccine against this disease when we said goodbye to a lady The Mo HIV positive God Bless You are positive that God I bless I was displaced I was excited, thinking that with my work I could and I can help save the lives of many people despite the successes and the many satisfactions to stars and stripes always thinks At Italy and his beloved land I don't want to be in the USA I want to return to Italy the question is when at the moment the hypothesis of returning and continuing to do research as in America seems far away for now Giuseppe remains in Washington waiting to be able to return from his family And from his friends the Italy says is a beautiful country with many resources starting from the many talent I who often have difficulty finding growth opportunities one of the most beautiful aspects of life in the USA is the often real feeling of having many opportunities especially if you are young the certainty that if you do your job well sooner or later you get what you want to have This feeling is often more important than the opportunity because you always feel motivated to go on and adds personal and professional growth for us young people must be a goal to be achieved with enthusiasm and determination everywhere going abroad should not be an obligatory choice but only an option dictated by one's passions
What Italy is experiencing Italy is an exodus equal to that of the second post -war period an bleeding of compatriots who leave the country to seek better conditions, graduates of families with the elderly minors must be graduated, the press traces the picture and explains that the numbers of the Aire that is Of the Italian registry, abroad tell only part of the phenomenon because those data must be crossed with the other registry statistics of the Maggori European countries already the numbers in the hands of the Farnesina, however, outline a clear picture from the 3 1 million Italians abroad registered in 2006 it was passed to 5 1 million in 2018 in the last year there are 123 193 those who have decided to transfer the residence abroad a number underlines the Turin newspaper which is equivalent to the population of Monza or Pescara on 27 4 of those who go between 18 and the 34 years but compared to the previous year there was an increase of almost 3 percent of people between 35 and i 49 years overall the 56 of the Expat has between 18 and 44 years old while in 19 of cases they are a minors who indicates how entire family nuclei to expatriate and the degree of education of those who go is higher than the Past 34 6 has the average license 34 8 is graduated and 30 graduated and if we think it is only those who emigrate to Italy to send the money at home we are wrong our expats in 2016 sent home about 7 billion about half a point of pil money that does not compensate for the investment made by Italy to form them and of which other countries will benefit each doctor of research has cost about 230 thousand euros in the state while a 170 thousand graduate and a graduate 90 thousand looking at the cities the largest number of departures is from Milan then Rome Genoa Turin and Naples on the Regions front instead the Italians start above all from Lombardy Veneto Sicily Emilia Romagna and Liguria The first destination is Germany 20 thousand Italians who arrived at the beginning of 2018 then United Kingdom 18 517 and France 12 870 even if with Brexit the appearances in the UK dropped from 25 2 to be underlined also the increases in the age groups grow by 20 7 the departures of those who have between 50 and the 64 years +35 3 for those who are between 65 and 74 years old and +78 6 from 85 years upwards we talk about social security emigrants those who over 60 decide to spend the years of retirement abroad a one -way ticket for Portugal Brazil Spain e Ireland
They have left above all in Great Britain and Switzerland and for the most part orthopedic pediatricians anesthesiologist gynecologists abroad that represents a problem today and it will be even more tomorrow because the national health system has already lost and will lose even more professionals from 2005 to 2015 over ten thousand doctors 10 104 left Italy and in the same period 8 thousand nurses also made the suitcases and moved abroad to the data of the European Commission and the Eurispes ENPAM report those of Consultsi Group are added according to which every year 1 500 medicine graduates go away to attend enormous damage to specialization if you take into account how the Anaao Assomed category union has indicated that between pensions accrued with the Fornero law and quota 100 the National Health Service will lose 70 thousand white carriages until 2023 On the current 110 thousand according to estimates between only six years in 2025 to heal the In fact, the hospital will be even more difficult to appeal 16 500 specialists not only the damage caused by abroad is also cheap because training costs the Italian state 150 thousand euros for each individual doctor, the doctors who fled abroad have on average between 28 and i 39 years the 33 chose to go to the United Kingdom on 26 in Switzerland the region from which they emigrate more is Veneto from where the governor Luca Zaia launched the alarm 1 300 doctors, the reason for this situation is a national programming Wrong starting from the closed number in universities passing for the lack of specialization bags, the non -use in the hospitals of young specializing the absurdities of not being able to find forms to retain those who retire to 65 years of age and for those who remain in the lane increase the difficulty and the superlavoro and at hand the desire to leave the reasons that induce many professionals to L Asciale Italy explains Massimo Tortorella President of Consulcesi who in partnership with the Italian Medical Society of Great Britain IMSOGB also deals with the formation of Italian white cans in the United Kingdom here, access to the profession is more meritocratic the career prospects are better and the wages are much higher states and still Italy undertakes in the formation of excellent health professionals by spending huge sums of money and then gives this heritage to the other dozens of the testimonies that has collected in recent years among the expats that now live in Great Britain has me The story of two Italians who work today in a famous London hospital tells Tortorella are affected by Rome and Milan in their cities were forced to arrange themselves among underpaid works and periods of inactivity in London have met in love have found work and made a career say that not they would return to Italy not even a Equality of salary concludes and I really don't feel like blaming them
 Every time I got off the train I was in front of a billboard welcome to Bonn the United Nations City so when it was time to look for a job, I was natural to knock on that 28 -year -old Mattia Cerutti door of Gambara small center of the lower Bresciana works in Germany For three years now, the UNCDD consultant The UN Convention for the fight against desertification that is based in Bonn Mattia has spent the last year of studies in Erasmus immediately before graduating in vegetable and agro -trained biotechnologies from the Milan Statale already then in 2015 He understood that his future would not be in Italy talking to the university companions I realized how they were not at all worried about the post graduate said they took for granted that by investing many years in the study they would find a job paid for the right something natural sin that from us it is not at all so Mattia begins to send applications A bit everywhere except in Italy by exploiting the accumulated experience by working on the thesis dedicated to the study of a gene that allows some plants to survive for a long time without water is a candidate for a place of interior at the Uncdd by winning two days after graduating in Milan I was ready To start the new job, I have been reminded since then I have not moved from here but I don't consider myself a brain on the run simply I have never limited my action field to a single country in the coming years I would like to work somewhere else and then who knows Maybe to return but that is a long -term plan admitted to take for granted that by investing many years in the study they would find a job paid for the right but in Italy this thing is not natural after the six months of unpaid internship is keen to specify even all the UN All is roses and flowers Mattia is assumed as a consultant to the Convention, his task is to help countries in V Development to elaborate plans to mitigate and prevent the effects of drought in collaboration with local institutions since then has gone on with renewed fixed -term contracts year by year but I have never felt precarious explains here the work is lived in a more way Elastic that in Italy no one has the dogma of the indefinite time because even in the event of non -renewal for the specialized professions, finding a new job is extremely easy from the start then I had a higher salary than I could have aspired at home and the It is nice that for German standards it is not at all high the most stimulating aspect tells is the air of melting pot that can breathe in the workplace perhaps there is no more international environment than this because each of the 193 Member States must be represented in agencies and conventions means working every day with colleagues from all over the globe certainly also means an a Mbiente very competitive and not always about healthy competition but personally by every morning at work with a smile so much that the dream is to win the JPO The competition for officials under 30 that the Farnesina banks every year thus entering the organization on a stable plan for Two years in a row I applied and I arrived according to I touch the entrance to the UNEP the environmental program of the United Nations I hope that the next one is the good one I am sure that I will return even if I can't imagine to do it shortly in Germany now Mattia yes He also feels at home in everyday life after the Erasmus I ran away from Bonn and now I live in Cologne which is much more beautiful and is less than half an hour at work I speak English and Spanish but over the years I have learned a good German we say that I can talk about All biotechnology excluded jokes in relations with the premises Mattia noticed a certain difference in attitude in Base in age C is little to do the German elderly are unbearable wary of closed mentality you always feel a step above the others my peers instead are different you can see that they are used to thinking Outside The Box as they say in English have traveled they feel they feel Europeans is much easier to have to deal with it and he as a young European man became passionate about the country's politics that hosts him when under the gazebo of the AFD alternative Fr Deutschland the extremely right German party I also saw the under 30 I was scared at the Governments of Angela Merkel must be recognized to have given the country a stability that is now strongly questioned here c is a formidable welfare system also thanks to all the refugees who have been welcomed in recent years it can be said that young Syrians are paying Pensions to the Germans who are a very old people like us, however, as much as he emigrated satisfied but Mattia does not do Part of the group of Italy's denigrators I will never speak badly of my country because I love it deeply says and I have the utmost respect for those who remain I don't think that we are happy and made it is impossible I think it is much more difficult one day I am sure that I will return even if I can't imagine doing it shortly, even if I now deal with development policies, my real passion is botany and in particular the Mediterranean species as a child instead of the toys I asked Santa Lucia the plants of bergamot and lentisco When I have the means I would like to devote myself to the extraction of their essential oils and I certainly can't do it in Bonn it's too cold
 I was homosexual terrone and I wanted to make the artist in short in Italy I had all the requirements for a Serie C life so I started but one day my country will have to apologize to me Davide Cocchiara 32 years old lives in Amsterdam where he recently started his new job of Copywriter for an advertising company but until 2016 he made the dancer the profession he had always dreamed of and that allowed him to travel the world obtaining prestigious awards since the years of high school at Vittorini in Naples I knew I was gay and I knew I would have He wanted to dance but I also knew I lived in Italy and specifically in Naples a place where the life I wanted was not included in the catalog of available dreams therefore abandoned the university without having given even an exam in 2005 leaves for Livorno where he passes the audition to enter the Codarts of Rotterdam The largest dance school of Europe a four -year course which in Holland is equated to a real e Just a degree course I was 18 years old I didn't know how to cook a floor to make the washing machine or the shopping I did not know how to do anything because in Naples the only idea of ??leaving the house at that age is inconceivable reminds when I started my my eyes full of Tears like to be with mom and dads up to 30 even if they make fun of us all over the world it doesn't matter when I left I was 18 years old and I didn't know how to do anything in Naples the only idea of ??leaving home at that age It is inconceivable and yet Davide does not get frightened and climbs on the plane for Rotterdam so unwanted I discovered that a world there was a world for just over two hours of flight where I could be myself live my passion without ashamed and my loves without being condemned winters are cold the tongue is difficult to learn and coffee is not as good as in Naples but it doesn't matter the quality of life does the quality of people here me s I always heard at home and the rare times that someone insulted me because I walked by the hand with another boy I was defended instinctively and naturally by anyone around and the same I saw happening when being attacked was a person of color already A year before concluding the training course Davide obtains the first contract from a company in Amsterdam from there and for the following ten years he will go from one company to the other by moving first to Groningen then to Haarlem again in Amsterdam and finally in Antwerp in Belgium he performs In hundreds of shows in the most prestigious theaters in the world up to Brazil and South East Asia in 2013 he won the best dancer prize of the Netherlands L after he becomes critical in his sector for a specialized British magazine he also knew Dutch Boris also dancer who from Six years he is his partner I was doing the life I had always dreamed of and I earned the triple of what I had at He could aspire to Italy by us the only way to break through with dance is to make those programs like friends where they throw you a quarter to now in the spotlight and if you are lucky you become famous but if you want to be a theater dancer and live your passion It is better to give up at the start explains in Italy the only way to break through with dance is to make those programs like friends where they throw you a quarter of now in the spotlight and if you are lucky you become famous after so many years without ever stopping, however, the stressful rhythms of life Of a professional dancer, they begin to be heard after I broke a foot and fractured a vertebra I started to discourage me also tells the 30 years you are already old to make this profession how the players become expensive and not very convenient and struggle to find new opportunities but Davide has not done the university has no type of competence different from the dance in short in Italy would be abandoned to It is uninhabilitable for any employer in Holland, however, there is different here there is a fund for artists a kind of pension in which we pay the 1 of our salary after ten years the sum that we have accumulated is multiplied by the Dutch state and becomes a treasure that We can invest in training to learn a new job like this Davide and Boris together enroll in the Miami headquarters in School in Berlin the most important advertising school in the world a fee of 21 thousand euros entirely paid by the Dutch state we have always worked in team I do the Copywriter Him l art director I think of the content he for the form during the two years of school always in pairs in London experiences Copenhagen Madrid Barcelona until both are taken on a temporary time by a Amsterdam agency returning to live in the country in they met sooner or later we will get married when we are more stable d Another part here after two fixed -term contracts the indefinite weather automatically takes adopted a child I would like but Boris not at least for now tells Davide and returning to Italy now I don't think about it still says my new house is here if I had stayed in Italy they are sure I wouldn't have made the dancer I could not have lived my love with fullness and I would have been less happy luckily I chose another path
Parties looking for a job, emigrants also exist in Italy go to the north of the country towards Europe towards America leave the family as in the early twentieth century with an ideal cardboard suitcase here are some of their stories told in Valigiandicartone ilFaretto gmail com my name is Gabriella I am 38 years old and I have been living in Switzerland for graduate as an interpreter and translator in Rome I live up to 33 years of age my Roman life like my peers a boyfriend for years and various work experiences but to work as a translator who was my dream With a stable contract, not even the shadow over the years I therefore make jerking translations in black and for the need to have a safe entry alongside this activity of mine at the part time call center until I find a job at an event company where it is also required to do translations Fantastic pity that even there for three years I work completely in black I continue to send curriculum to Rome because that It is my dream but they don't even answer me until my life suffers a sudden turning point my story with her boyfriend ends and shortly afterwards I meet the man who is my husband today with whom he almost 5 years ago decides to go to live where he lives from Years in Switzerland I take a expectation from the call center and try to live three months then another 3 then 6 and today I am still happy and satisfied here shortly after my arrival I get a contract in a school with children then a job in the documents management of a large company and finally the work of my permanent life translator in the bank during all years spent working in black I had depressed I thought I was not worth anything and I was not at the height instead was not so being selected by a great one Bank between two hundred people gave me confidence in myself I go back to my city about once a month given the short distance by plane and I am ashamed to tell the truth Rome I don't miss or Gni I come back from my affections I only see a city in degradation a great dissatisfaction and unhappiness of the people who live there and who do nothing but complain what to miss ah yes something there is pizza my advice to those who live this situation In Italy it is to leave and look for new roads if you cannot make you there where you are most likely it is not your fault but of a company that does not allow you to try new roads, test yourself to the test your limits with the awareness that nothing is definitive and You can return to Italy when you want nobody puts you in prison the only contraindication you will be yourself to no longer want to return
The choice of an unconventional school compared to that of his friends the meeting with two university professors who opened his mind and then his studies in Pisa an internship in Potsdam and the doctorate in Cambridge in development biology in the Department of Plant Sciences a Path that at just 27 years old led Fabrizio Ticchiarelli to Co signed a research article in the magazine Nature and to enter the international scientific panorama I have always been fascinated by plant biology so when it was to choose high schools I decided to enroll in the technical institute agrario Celso Ulpiani of Ascoli Piceno has started everything from there and I owe a lot to my parents others in their shoes they would have forced me to attend a school perceived as more respectable socially for luckily they were not so myopian that decision tells Fabrizio was the first point of turned on his life then the unexpected registration came At the Santo Anna high school in Pisa I was not even sure I wanted to go to the university was the chemistry teacher who spur me the memory of those years is a perpetual alternation between Library and Laboratory lessons because Sant Anna is the pressure, however, is surrounded by People full of enthusiasm and extremely competent has enriched me a lot of experiences abroad have exposed me to a variety of prospects and research approaches that are difficult to replicate in Italy between these two teachers to whom Fabrizio attributes part of the merit of his successes the current rector of the school Pierdomenico Perata and Francesco Licausi now associated professor of plant physiology at the University of Pisa have had a crucial impact on my career, words are not sufficient to explain how much their role of models and mentors has influenced my mentality clarifies a stimulating environment in which it is Decisio also matured Nor to continue my studies outside Italy during the Triennale I worked for 4 months at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology in Potsdam in Germany and at the end of the specialist I spent a 6 -month period at the Sainsbury Laboratory of the University of Cambridge is here that Fabrizio has decided to stop for the doctorate these experiences have exposed me to a variety of prospects and research approaches that are difficult to replicate in Italy to work abroad means to face new challenges to grow both from a human and professional point of view adds without neglecting some practical advantages Cambridge is a collegial system in which the university and the various colleges provide complementary services to students, for example, in addition to traditional lessons, in -depth lessons are organized in small groups of 1 5 people under the supervision of an expert on the subject what it means that A 27 year old like him p I already have the first teaching experiences and also paid unlike Italy here a doctolendo is paid 40 50 pounds per hour for his lessons he explains but there is also a straight line to pay that reaches over 9 thousand pounds in the case of three -year students and masterful can be addressed with a series of university loans and translates into very burdensome personal debts in the case of scientific doctoral students, on the other hand, is covered by the funds used for research which often also guarantee a minimum annual salary of 14 thousand pounds another big difference concerns Precisely the resources intended for the Cambridge University attracts a quantity of exorbitant funds both through the winning of international research calls which, through private donations, for example the Sainsbury Laboratory is sponsored by a charitable association called Gatsby Foundation that finances research in areas of vegetable biology for different millions of s Tertine per year a structure of excellence that in 2012 also won the Sterling for Architecture Award I have a great debt towards the Italian educational system that in my case was decisive here Fabrizio has reached a goal that represents the dream of many scientists to see His name printed in Nature magazine The article is the result of the collaboration between the group of my institute directed by Professor Ottine Leyser and the group of Professor Ning Zheng of the University of Washington concerns a vegetable hormone L'argolatone that plays a role both in the colonization of the environments terrestrial by plants both in the transition of the axillary gems from the dormant to the active state and therefore in the growth of the branches that have direct consequences in the world in which we live, think of the landscape impact that the architecture has taken from a plant with full maturity from number of branches then also depends the NU mere of flowers and fruits produced by a plant, that is, the production of food in the case of most species cultivate work in an international team, however, it is not so simple you can find you use the language of the signs to speak by mixing three different languages ??or to draw to communicate Effectively or finding yourself saying completely normal things in your country which, however, are extremely offensive in the culture of the country in which you are wants to emphasize Fabrizio in England it is rare to criticize colleagues the observations must be made indirectly and courteously, you risk not to perceive their criticisms because they are communicated too veiled but there are many positive sides in such a multicultural context, everyone can teach you something new from the kitchen to a language, people are more available to accept the oddities that distinguish each of us because they know well how you feel to change the house and leave family And friends behind him looking back Fabrizio is sure I have chosen the right path I have a great debt towards the Italian educational system that in my case was decisive from a training and financial point of view I would not have done anything of this without the support of people grandiose who motivated me to make ambitious decisions even when they seemed to exceed my abilities, the important thing is to choose mentors who have your personal development at heart and do not see you as a tool to be exploited for their purposes and if there was a Occasion of returning I would be happy to return a bit of what I received if I had the opportunity to do it for now I will stay here to finish the last year of doctoral and probably to complete some projects as a post doc after I would still like to move to know another country learn something again
 I love my job I dream of becoming a cardiologist since I am 18 years old but I went back maybe I would do the farmer to be with my family I don't wish anyone to be forced to emigrate like me Davide Civita is an internist doctor in the third year of specialization in Germany works in the Bad Reichenhall hospital in Bavaria near Salzburg in the intensive care unit wanting to do this job at all costs requested sacrifices had to give up the affections and his home in Andria from Puglia undertaken a journey that took him first in Slovakia then in Germany where he knew Mobbing and discrimination but also many professional satisfactions unfortunately the dishonesty in Italy I could have already had a family to chase the work I gave up the affections after the high school Davide enrolled in the faculty of biology in Siena disappointed by Environment tries to follow his dream cardiology even if tut You around him tried to direct him towards dentistry everyone told me dad is dentist you already have everything ready attempts the test of the access to the medical faculty does not pass I am not brought for the quizzes, however, admits Davide is not in favor of the abolition of the closed number Which for a moment seemed a concrete possibility unless the rapid reverse of the government that denied the whole limited number is necessary but the test as it is formulated is not indicative of the skills of a doctor rather it would be appropriate to put a limit to the repetition of the Exams in my university to the third failed attempt is expelled and you had to start again as people do not park themselves in university and graduate in reasonable times, however, reflects Davide C is a question of supply and demand the Federation of General Medicine provides for an bleeding of 45 thousand doctors in 5 years only partially compensated by the new hires What is needed to limit the places if the doctors are missing unfortunately the dishonesty in Italy I could have already had a family to chase the work I gave up the affections so David enrolled in a university university by chance a colleague of his father talks to him about the faculty of Medicated Kosice medicine with the universities of Pavia Bari and with Federico II a city with a first difficult impact file of huge gray barracks all the same as an unknown and difficult language a beautiful experience reasons with hindsight but demanding and expensive works like i American college I had to invest 80 thousand euros to self -financial, but the biggest break was to see other people who like him had been excluded from the test, however, attend the university every year in Medicine enters an avalanche of recursists even with a low score and for specializations there They are reserved places for those who have already entered the national health system maybe you enter I do in a private clinic this favors the children of the doctors are very few cases but they exist the graduation returns to Italy and he immediately puts himself back to studying for the entrance tests to the specialization cardiology is very coveted the places are few again this time nothing to do while waiting To repeat the test asks and gets an unpaid internship at San Raffaele my dream passed through my hands I knew that it was only a temporary stop for me I counted the days that separated me from the departure from Milan tries to send curricula to Switzerland they take it For a place in the emergency room then it remains on the ground because of the cuts to the staff last stop, Germany finally arrive the cards for approval but the environment is not easy in the first clinic in which the mobbing works is so pressing that they forced him to resign they called me Pizzaiolo Mangiaspaghetti I worked at each holiday I had accumulated 750 hours of extraordinary is due in On the point of a lawyer, however, it is called something here it is easy to have legal assistance for cases of discrimination at work at least the protections work in the new structure things are better the relationships with new colleagues are good Davide is happy with his job I do a lot of practice They leave me a lot of autonomy and this is an excellent incentive says that Germany is a coveted destination for many Italian undergraduates many have yet to finish the exams and they are already informed to come and specialize here one of the reasons is the request for workforce and the salary significantly higher despite the cost of life, the Facebook Italian doctors group in Germany with almost 5 thousand subscribers is the refuge of those looking for advice on how to get the approach, that is, the pass to work as a doctor in the German system leave me a lot of autonomy and this is an excellent one Incentive according to Davide in Italian hospitals there is so much to do for example Andr The emergency room reorganized and the waste c is a basic management problem, you do not get economy, even if you do not control how many medicines and drugs are stolen, the specializing then should be a resource nobody wants to form you but everyone is looking for you as a specialist the problem is also Politician and starts from the top to the Ministry of Health you have to have people with a long experience in hospitals who know what the problems are and how to intervene to Davide the sun is missing the olive trees of the campaign of his grandfather his brothers one is in Switzerland in Spain in Spain to smaller we suggested studying art thinks a little to go back to Italy for now remains a dream I would agree to do another thing in order to be close to the family but I know that they would tell me after all the sacrifices you did what you come back to do
 Since we moved to England four years have not always been easy but all full of life Silvia and Marco Forgione have been married for 25 years and have two children Lisa 28 and Alberto 24 until 2013 all four woke up in Milan where they had one Beautiful house a stable economic situation and the most expensive affections but when the two boys emigrated to England the parents decided to reach them by abandoning many certainties and fifty years of memories, my husband and I say Silvia we had to choose whether to stay or live for the future following following Our children a choice that was difficult but who says Marco makes us feel as if we lived two lives in one in Milan I also struggled to find an unpaid internship the first to leave was Lisa psychologist forensic in the maximum security prison of Newport on the Wight island born in 1990 understood that his future would not be in Italy while studying Psicol Ogia to Cattolica from the first day the teachers repeated that there was no work and we had to invent something then followed an English course in London and applied for the Master in Forensic Psychology at the University of Portsmouth in Milan I also struggled to find An unpaid prerequisite internship to access the Master in the UK in Italy you can become a psychologist without having ever seen a patient which means that you can do very serious damage if compared the English detention system with the Italian one cannot help but notice that we are Back light years here everything is evidence based, the British measure everything and studying the recurrence rate they realized that it is better to rehabilitate the prisoners that leaving them twenty years in jail the state here is smart we do not learn from the experience today Lisa is asking for citizenship British has just taken the house in Southampton and every morning he goes to work in the hovercraft on the island of Wight Qu Ando took me for a professional doctorate in forensic psychology I seemed to have won the lottery I have an excellent salary higher than a qualified psychologist in Italy and I can continue to form my Lisa University my highest salary of a qualified psychologist in Italy I was afraid of not making her his was the first stage of a family exodus that involved his brother Alberto in the first place today Videogame Developer when I saw the avant -garde equipment of the University of Portsmouth I felt like a child in an enchanted world that has always been passionate Alberto attended a technical institute of Milan when he visited Lisa in 2013 who was finishing the first year of Master and decided to attend him in Portsmouth a degree course in Games Technology I was afraid of taking the longest step of the Gamba confesses my votes they were not high and I was afraid of not doing it and instead things They went very differently, graduated with the highest votes and a thesis rewarded as Best Game Project 2017 now works as a programmer help in England where there are many more video games companies that in Italy return is not in the programs at least without a perspective in the industry of the Videogame often happens to think that it would have been more comfortable to remain anchored to my country without ever abandoning comfort zone but there is no experience that he ever made me feel so alive and if it had not been for the support received by mine I don't know where I would be There were many aspects of our life in Italy that we could no longer stand the Forgione family recompact in Portsmouth four years ago after Marco and Silvia put aside their certainties to follow their children both had a consolidated career she accountant for an IT company he member of a software house and highly experienced IT consultant for too long though Silvia had shared the fears of her daughter Lisa on the future during the three -year degree every day it was increasingly clear that the future would have been cube so when the idea of ??attending the master in Portsmouth has proposed to me my instinct had told me that it would be a journey A one -way one couple of years later dad and mom reached it there were so many aspects of our life in Italy tells Marco that we could no longer endure the unknowns were many from giving up the work to start from scratch a decision of the genre says Marco In addition to all the problems of consciousness it also involves practical difficulties to sell the house was very difficult and we accepted a lower offer to move everything we had accumulated in 25 years of life together was very dear we selected what we wanted to keep and sold the rest to sell The house was very difficult as well as to leave our affections the first year of Marco and Silvia devastating after having spent almost all the value of our house in an Italian franchise of pasta and piadina who did not work we found ourselves more than 50 years to deal with the life crumbs that had remained we bought a house And Silvia tells I desperately searched for a job I started off selling tickets and guides at the Naval Museum of Portsmouth I was lucky because I also speak French with that job for the first time Silvia kept the whole family and at the time Marco's English was too uncertain To find work and so they left with the apprenticeship the worst moment was when I found myself a line manager little older than my arrogant and proud daughter to humiliate me had told me that they had voted for Brexit because of people like us but start again It was not easy I had left many certainties gained to the sound of sacrifices over the years says Silvia and my parents Anzia ni many great friends colleagues a beautiful house Marco continued to look for work for months continuing to study English after a year of application interviews and English school I found a job equal to that left in Italy I don't think that the opposite would have been possible what Marco surprised is meritocracy and after several blowers and many hard work she too has found her position as an accountant I like work and I am surrounded by people who appreciate my identity and do not treat me as a person who came here to steal theirs Jobs The Budget of the Collective Transfer we are very lucky says Silvia day after day we want to demonstrate that we are worth everything beautiful and fascinating but it takes a lot of flexibility
You say the meteorologist and you immediately think of Colonel Giuliacci or another officer of the Aeronautics standing in front of a map with the silhouettes of the sun and the clouds also Andrea is a meteorologist but does not bring the military uniform he does not work on TV and does not control currents And rainfall on our peninsula but on the island of Bermuda Andrea Pedrini is 29 years old and is originally from Senigallia studied in Bologna but to exercise his profession he had to go first to England then in the middle of the Atlantic where he lives with his girlfriend Serena di Forl In Italy the weather is almost associated with the horoscope, people take it as a vague indication on how the day will be like will be the meteorology beyond the practical use of the predictions of the app a complex matter that applies and intertwined with the economy to agriculture ai transport to the health and safety of people especially in such a delicate moment due to climate change in C Orso Andrea graduated in physics of the atmosphere and meteorology course closed after a few years with the Gelmini reform for the scarce number of subscribers was a little known path but the closure of the faculty filed even more the subject after graduation began to look at each other Around and looking for work I wanted to understand if with the master's degree I could have more outlets but I saw that even the colleagues of the specialist were struggling to work then I decided to make the jump and leave for reading C is the best school of expensive meteorology yes but surely you have A road already marked, the training is aimed at inserting the world of work I made the thesis on the English sailing team engaged in the America's Cup which then recalled me asking me to continue the project I practically set foot outside the university and the next day I started The training period was also paid to work I set foot out of the The University and the next day I also started working the training period was paid in Italy there is no national weather service as all other European countries have it to take care of the Air Force and the Civil Protection that works above all on emergencies and on Alerts if n has been spoken for many years but it is still a vague project despite our country is exposed to some weather risks such as floods and droughts in Italy there are also specific weather services but they are still a niche and thinking that instead this science was born just With us with the intuitions of Leonardo and Galilei and the invention of the Torricelli barometer we have been pioneers but we must update and keep up with the rest of the world the problem is also cultural, that is, of how the profession is perceived the meteorology is not an enhanced subject A guy who wants to undertake this profession would not know where com from Emblected despite this or perhaps for this reason Andrea would like to go back to work in Italy I would like to make available to my country what I learned abroad but I already know that I should start from scratch and maybe change the job here I was able to do the job for which I studied is not obvious his girlfriend Serena has always worked in the fashion sector making the dirt between Italy and England as an academic quality nobody beats us but then there is no connection with the world of work both we would like to return home but return means to be satisfied Of what is when there is perhaps not relevant to our paths the apprenticeship we have to do it all but in Italy there are fewer opportunities to demonstrate who you are and what you know how to do think about it and add here you are fine but still Italy is Italy Here I was able to do the job for which I studied is not obvious therefore especially with the Brexit in the air the idea was that of Ria Wide at home but in the meantime a call from Bermuda things comes to know in reality the correct name is Plural Bermude islands because it is an archipelago with Hamilton capital still territory d Oltremare of the English crown The British sailing team was located there for the cup America C was a tour of contacts and they made my name in the meantime Andrea had started working for a multinational that provides specific weather services to energy and transport industries I often found myself doing work for Italian companies a paradox The offer This is how the two boyfriends move to the subtropical band of the planet between postcard beaches and hurricane risk around the corner must be learned to manage potentially catastrophic events therefore Andrea had to make a training period in Miami at the Noaa the Federal Agency of the United States that monitors atmosphere and oceans was all to s weighing of the company and I was the first Italian to enter during a great satisfaction now Andrea works in an international team I was welcomed with great professionalism I learned a lot have bet on me and I am very grateful to my managers Bermuda has the highest cost of the Life in the world is the Switzerland of the Atlantic Ocean a naturalistic paradise but also fiscal we are talking about a very small island just over sixty thousand inhabitants and no universities a community as big as Cosenza but in the middle of the sea isolated from all on the street they all greet you as in the villages explains Have fun in many sectors, the government needs to import highly specialized workforce there are also many Italian expats especially of Capri who work in catering or import exports every now and then Andrea is invited by his former professors to speak in schools my advice is to always be curious and not to be afraid We are a creative people of bankruptcy we have shown that we can do great things and abroad our job is always appreciated I would never have expected to finish here but in life we ??change
 I don't miss Italy because I am angry with her I didn't have to be forced to leave everything in 2012 when Stefano Messina is 46 years old a just arrived daughter and the permanent place I had been in the police for 25 years I never thought to expatriate but after the birth of Amina could no longer see a future for her was mortifying not being able to get to the end of the month so she begins to look around Canada United States finally the countries of northern Europe in Norway C were incentives for young people but also to bring children to the world and make them Studying after sending several curriculum Stefano starts in March 2013 I had 900 euros for the journey in caravan and it was not easy to eat when the company called me for a seasonal job the heart fought strong and I immediately told the departure immediately It was charged with responsibility I could not fail I knew I had to find something better so Stefano puts himself on leave and part Guide for kilometers from Rome where he lived to Flekkeroy I went first then after a few months he reached my partner with the girl for three months we lived in the caravan then we found a house to go from occasional work to a fixed job not It was easy above all because of the language I had the titles but I did not know the Norwegian were difficult months my girlfriend was worried I went out in the morning and I went to bring curriculum to the end, but the stability arrives overlooked two companies the first of transport the Second of fish here you can have two works without problems at the same time explains Stefano I had taken all the licenses in unsuspected times have been very useful and so the new life begins in Norway during the week Stefano works in a company that sells the fish of the day On Saturdays and Sundays instead he travels with the truck after two years I left my job The weekend and I only kept the one with the fishing company where I am still explains Stefano who also underlines the difference in salary in Italy I took as assistant police head of 1500 euros per month here I earn 3000 and I am considered like a worker he says Surely the prices are not the same increases in fact the cost of some foods but in some area you can even save the electricity costs less and also the rent here pay 700 euros for a house in Rome I spent 800 for an apartment in the suburbs here yes They complain of taxes but I know how much we pay in Italy and what services we receive I say to everyone not to do it for him the real turning point is in the attention to the citizen when my daughter was born in Italy and I took the days that I was responsible for returning to work They looked at me badly relegating me to do the worst jobs here instead when my second child was born, it would be on the contrary they would have me He looked badly if I had not taken my days of leave c, it wanted time to change mentality an example my daughter entered very well at the kindergarten when I had to register it was a Friday and I requested by email already on Monday they called me to start the Insertion we are talking about an efficiency that in Italy dreams of it explains Stefano many concessions for those who decide to have children from the discounts family if you buy large quantities of some products including the diapers at the baby bonus up to the university paid with the money borrowed from State that must be returned to installments only after finding a job in this too the two countries have an abysmal difference in Italy I did not know I was entitled to the bonus I learned about the traverse routes I was due 1100 euros here my son was born the November 3, 2017 and it was the midwife who explained to us how to do it was sufficient to enter the Ministry's website with the tax code and do Dom The check came after 30 days and it was 6500 euros to motivate such a radical choice of life was his daughter I wanted him to play his chances like everyone else studying or choosing not to do it I just wanted to see her happy the idea of ??returning In Italy the country that disappointed him and mortified despite the fixed work is not in the floors my son would never have been born if I had stayed in Rome I look at him and I think back to my choice certainly here too there are negative aspects but if you put them on the balance they win The positive ones then continues when I left the police I thought I would have been bad instead I felt relief asked me but how you leave your sureness and for what but in the uncertainty and only with my strength I managed to bring out something good
 I have always had the habit of moving since I was a child so when I was no longer satisfied in Italy and I started Ciro Borriello born in 1987 in a certain sense is the stereotype of the brain in the escape engineer aerospace engineer graduated from the Polytechnic of Turin in the 2012 but for two years he had already worked in an Italian start -up owned by one of the largest civil planes manufacturers then after five years of low salary and promises not kept the choice to start over in 2015 with a master in Business Administration in Cambridge From there the destiny led him to Darmstadt in Germany where since August he has been taken indefinitely by Eumetsat the intergovernmental agency that manages the European network of meteorological satellites at this moment with its team is developing three couples of new generation satellites that will provide the data necessary for weather forecast for the whole European continent a project with the value of 2 and a half billion in Italy I had never seen funding over one or two million told us they promised us that they would fifteen the employees and we would all have had an important increase Ciro was born in Holland where the parents of Campania origin had moved for work he did The kindergarten in Ischia and the elementary school in Caserta before settling in Turin at the age of 11 under the Mole remained until it was 28 at 23 years old immediately after the three -year degree I started working I joined a start -up that He made thermal and mechanical projects as soon as I arrived, the company was acquired by a large group to be employed by such an important company gave me the push to stay there throughout the master's degree alternating the work with the study, the promises remembered were high -sounding had promised us that the employees would have fifted and we would all have had an important increase after five years but the one ca what to grew up were my responsibilities, the salary had remained practically the same and the new hires had only been seen in the slightest part so the young engineer gives up everything and enrolled in a master's degree in the administration of the University of Cambridge the most prestigious of the United kingdom to refine the management and project manager skills in recent years in Turin I dealt more than anything else than that I decided to invest even in a field other than pure engineering explains I chose Cambridge because it had the best tradition in the scientific technological field and Very good employment prospects to study in such a renowned university, however, it has its cost 40 thousand pounds for a year of courses that I hit from my savings and with help from my family remember but it was worth it a few months before ending The Master had various offers including one of the Eumetsat really essential Skilled here everyone collaborates with the other, the activity is organized to perfection and also the ecosystem helps to work better Ciro so change the third country in two years destination Darmstadt German city a few kilometers from Frankfurt for the first two years works with a contract As a consultant in August 2018, the first big difference with Italy is inserted in the staff I do not negotiate it is the salary here pay me more than double also working for an intergovernmental agency I have the advantage that my earnings are exempt even explains the territory on which insists the headquarters of Eumetsat is exempt from German jurisdiction, international law applies the climate then is much more relaxed than that of private companies in which competitiveness between colleagues makes itself felt at any time everyone collaborates with the other the activity is organized to perfection and also the ecosystem helps to work better since He is in Germany he tells him has almost never happened to have to do extraordinary there is not this type of culture and in general it is not something well seen in Italy I happened to work much more than necessary and no one has ever considered it a strangeness indeed it was Almost a race for those who were most in the office c is also something that Ciro regrets his country, however, working here is like living in a bubble C is little exchange with the surrounding environment and this does not facilitate integration I have never even needed to Really learn German because only English is used at work, I suffer from the climate a bit in plaster and formal and I try to overcome it by attending the Italian colleagues who are many my goal however confesses is to return to Italy sooner or later I know that to do so I will have to give up a part of salary or accepting a less prestigious job but I don't care dream of being able to do research and development in my country to create something from nothing sooner or later I will succeed
Their second life blossomed a one -way ticket abroad to follow a dream or a better quality of life we ??told their stories on IlFattoquotidiano it and we have contacted them in these days to understand where they would spend the holidays if at home or in the country where they moved and if sooner or later their plan is to return a desire that do not hide like that of melancholy for those who have also left thousands of kilometers away would like to return but the price to pay is too high for Valentina It would mean depending on the parents because with the same role in Italian universities it would not be paid well as it is in Copenhagen for Roberto instead the idea of ??returning is confused with the unsustainable vortex of the Italian bureaucracy while in Drusilla they would mankind and open -minded stimuli and yet for many if there is there were the conditions the repatriation would be at the top of the wish list here I have the deposit Ilegio of a life that in Italy could not afford Michele Diom produced his latest film in New York with the Oscar winner James Ivory but in Italy assistance to cinema through the distribution of public funding with completely arbitrary methods has transformed the sector into A great machine to move electoral consent tells one day one day to finally produce his film in Italy without speculation and pressure of all kinds but at the moment this ideal scenario remains a dream for him as for Roberto Pagani who teaches the University in Iceland despite the His 25 years and feels he is respected valued as a doctoral while in Italy we are often treated as the professors who can not count the aid from the union who work here really adds then there are also the cases of those who have already left the years of the years of the work and that abroad with his Italian pension can enjoy I life rodolfo rizzo if n went 17 years ago to the Azores and back would not return as I could here is not pollution the climate is perfect zero crime exit and do not close the door of the house are privileges that I could not afford from us there are no conditions Interesting to date for my return to Italy, my thoughts in the long run is to return home Valentina Barletta from the Technical University of Denmark would be sure but only with salaries as a researcher adequate at the cost of living in the best case I would find myself again to have Depending on my my reply and she doesn't go to Copenhagen she has an apartment in the center, life is in size of a men and does not need to worry about her future Andrea Baldessari admits that in Hong Kong there are a thousand resources and a thousand opportunities but my thoughts In the long run it is to return to my country of origin Eleonora case has become accustomed to a standard of high life and Tornarebb And yes but only if the salary was adequate admits and then he should convince his partner who is not Italian to learn the language to return and find a job in Italy there is Drusilla Galelli who in Italy with his family really returned to us after having lived for years in Kuwait and tells that what is close is the lack of open -mindedness to live abroad you move you always gives you new challenges and you dream of perhaps leaving Maico Campilongo from Palo Alto would certainly return if he had the opportunity to create a company as well as He did in the United States by working honestly and without asking for favors in turn Antonio Riccio from Iraq still remains amazed by how the Emirates have been able to build a world economic center from the desert here tells me the opportunity to work without favoritism without corruption without having to pay a pledge I have nothing to some baron against Italy but now my life is here but if we speak A of Christmas holidays are all united by nostalgia almost whispering Michele is lucky because he has returned for a few days in his Naples and admits that the first challenge to make it abroad is to win the nostalgia of the Roberto will spend these days discuss whether to return With her Finnish girlfriend she says she is favorable but she has no idea what Rodolfo awaits him will flatten her Italian flag who waves from the house to the Azores but to explain he quotes Gaber I don't feel Italian but luckily or unfortunately I am Valentina will pass from Milan But only on a visit to Andrea Trentino speak of Italy today is linked to the memory of Antonio Megalizzi a young man who questioned himself like many of us going beyond the borders to find his own club has remained in Palo Alto but the nostalgia in these Days are the protagonist despite everything I immensely lack my Calabria and my family celebrating for Christmas Antonio thinks of all those who are chasing their dream away from Casa Eleonora instead is convinced that he wants to stay in Dubai even if more he agrees more I would like to return to Europe and then there is Matteo Frasson surgeon in Valencia that he will take the Spanish passport next year I feel I feel like a European citizen I have nothing against Italy here I have my job my children my economic stability on Christmas night called his parents his sister the closest friends then I went back to work I conclude this year I was on guard

 There is a train that starts up or do not go up the adventure of Emanuele Giovagnoli began in 2012 with this question then he was 29 years old and from Offagna Piccolo Borgo in the Marche had just moved to London today he has 35 and is the sound engineer Of the Jethro Tull historic prog group born in 1967 in Italy I made the backliner the touched guitars on stage and I did not see the possibility of growth here for a band that this year celebrates 50 years of activity and with them I make tour all over the world tells Emanuele in ilfattoquotidiano it my success was dictated by a mix of paraculism and luck born in 1984 after six years with them today Emanuele feels part of the group l start but it was not easy I moved to December 2010 I was 27 years old and I started again From the boss I discharged trucks like porter and I did sandwiches for 5 pounds at the time every day I wondered if it had been worth it since in Italy I was working in the Music world then thanks to a lucky email the turning point I wrote every day to the managers of the groups I was looking for the addresses on Google I also sent hundreds of emails per day until one day James Anderson the son of Ian the founder of the band gave me the Possibility to meet him in person the open position was that of Sound Engineer the technician who at each concert or performance deals with the mixer of the microphones and in general of all the management of audio a job that Emanuele had never done was a possibility that it would not be More recapitalized so when they asked me if I knew how to use the mixer I said yes before the trial evening I studied what I should have used on you tube tutorials and I went well I learned it on the road and in the various festivals I wrote Every day to the groups of the groups I was looking for the addresses on Google until that of jumping blindly was a choice that in the up or it was appropriate I did not want to find myself at 40 to ask me what it would happen if I had tried it or not still says Emanuele that he confessed only many trips and concerts after the lie of that first meeting the band he learned about it only five years later for punish me made fun of me in the tour of the tour where they wrote that I had asked to work in the catering I dreamed of a world tour I made six I was twice in Australia three in South America and 15 in the United States continues in Italy all this would be It was a mirage only with the big names of our music, in fact, similar results are achieved but getting there is very complicated in Italy we have sugar Pausini Jovanotti but it is a very small circuit once an artist finds his staff The spare part is difficult to explain Emanuele first I collaborated With a large society of live events without taking anything away from the artists with whom I worked I felt n On being able to grow qualitatively, I have given up a deadline making a world tour before 30 years the difference between the Italian and international musical circuits lies above all in the recognition of the importance of music only among the big names is really considered a job there is not for example The culture of the Tour Bus are part of the Road Crew turns like a crazy in summer macini kilometers on the highway but it is not considered important as I did ten years of parties here in southern Italy for example I was paid to the evening after you do Trento Cosenza at mid -August everything Running and for 150 euros you wonder if you want to go on the Italian pop in which Emanuele has played since she was 21 years old was her springboard I owe everything to that experience says if it should be compared to some sector in our country for Emanuele The music business in England is set as for us a construction company is treated as a Invoice sector also continues the underground circuit of minor artists here has so much movement after you do Trento Cosenza in mid -August everything running and for 150 euros you wonder if you want to go on thus to endorse the different weight of music in the multicultural English city are the opportunities who had thanks to his years with the rock band I met and shared stages with the Gallagher brothers members of the doors I prodigy my today is a business card that opens many doors explains here I am responsible for audio installation at the new Universal headquarters of Universal Music I have a small sound company in London and I am supplier of plants for events independently in a city that lives day and night like this you can afford to do as many things and build so much experience the passion for music has distant origins that start from An eko acoustic guitar with 12 ropes and arrive at the electric Gibson Les Paul of 72 I opened By chance a custody of my father tells Emanuele had a charm of his I was 9 years old and I fell in love with it despite not knowing what it was and that love for music has never passed is a world guided by the desire to dream and from the emotion still today I have stomach cramps and goosebumps when I hear the applause at the beginning of the concert The idea of ??returning to Italy is not in the floors despite the brexit from the referendum I felt stabbed behind I grew up in elementary school with the book citizens of Europe so they destroy The dream of a generation to which the European Union had been sold as an institution made of peace and love only if he managed to work with Oasis perhaps could be considered so satisfied that he wanted to return one day to know them was already a satisfaction if they called me I would go immediately Then I would come back aware, however, to know exactly where I am going among the many I would like to work with Omar Pedrini who I admire a lot then concludes in Italy we are genuine the same authenticity for which when I go back I sit at the villa in the village we are true
Parties looking for a job, the emigrants also exist in Italy go to the north of the country towards Europe towards America leave the family as in the early twentieth century with an ideal cardboard suitcase here are some of their stories told to Valigiandicartone ilFare Gail as I start from consideration that a liquid society like the current one or cavalchi as a surfers would do with the wave or you will have been submerged certainly from a degree you would expect anything else but after a life spent in Tuscany of studies and precarious work you know that time passes and with it A life I do not say happy that perhaps I doubt it exists but livable yes and then after studying and working in a sports center having passed competitions without winning them in various regions having worked in common in the sunny Versilia having faced difficult moments of health you find yourself with public work In the hospital in the average Valtellina the profile the task paraphrasing by Cristiano would say Making the works of spiritual and corporal mercy a job or vice versa in a more secular way to give their body to those who can no longer have it as it would like everything to say that the dignity of work is the starting point as well as the purpose that should cross any judgment Superficial heard and listened to and therefore judged anachronistic and involructive and to think that the possibility who knows how much really wanted to return to their land the Abruzzo with a stable place had materialized but only because the result of dedication and sacrifice the situations the moments and people are decisive in the choices is known to be difficult and winding paths addressed and overcome leave a vital wealth of spirit to face that melancholy who knows when and how to scratch because if everything has a price that of being alone or worse than feeling alone and remorse are of For the most demanding for those who have chosen to live Flavio Marr away one
Roberto Pagani left Italy on August 23, 2014 he had a degree in Nordic languages ??and in English with a year of Erasmus in Edinburgh I went away when I understood that the bureaucracy would always be targeted my wings tells I don't know many other countries in which I could have taught at the University already at 25 at the age of 28 Roberto is PhD student in Linguistics and Icelandic Codicology at the University of Iceland in Reykjavk where he also teaches Italian language and literature and is the alternate of the teacher owner in the courses of ancient Nordic return I prefer to be Test that staying in a system for the benefit of the mediocre, let's specify Roberto never felt forced to leave I moved abroad to see what would happen I have to say that mine proved to be a choice spot on by a researcher ended up studying The manuscripts of medieval sagas their national treasures as for us certain works of art explains the The main difference is that the Icelanders feel a lot of pride for their literary past in Italy I had never seen anyone more important than the president of the province of Cremona here I found myself in receptions in which the first minister or the president I moved abroad To see what would have happened, I must say that mine turned out to be a choice apart from the agility of bureaucracy 10 minutes to open a bank account 15 to buy a machine Lord is distinguished from Italy for the very relaxed attitude towards life Roberto's day varies according to the season usually arrival at university around 9 am but in winter when the dark continues until 11 in the morning it is more difficult to get up soon smiles Roberto works in the rni Magsson institute for Icelandic studies within the university campus On my desk I always have a cadast of open books covered with no You and Post It I work on my manuscripts and enter data on Excel for statistical purposes at 9 50 c is a yoga session at 10 break with coffee and tea and then continue with research and hours of lessons sometimes I stay in the institute to work until Late but it is still at my discretion to live winters close to the Arctic Circle, the darkness and the constant wind can not be very simple can be really heavy psychologically explains Roberto and yet the Icelanders are much less organized than the Italians never arrive on time not They never plan if they can avoid it and improvise by going to the last people in Iceland, however, they are also very creative teacher in making themselves and everyone does more than one job I myself continue the researcher over the years I have done the teacher the kindergarten master the translator and the guide tourist this ability to adapt makes the Icelandic very skilled in overcoming periods of crisis Roberto insists On the point here they are very informal if I had to meet the president in person I would turn to him using the name of the baptism and giving him of you in Italy you must always break out in the forest of conventions that contemplate forms of courtesy titles and how much else in Italy there is too much difference wage between workers and managers and in Iceland there are advantages also from an economic point of view I often hear from the Italians that young people do not want to work in Iceland from 16 years of age to work all at the supermarket coffers there are above all kids as well as In bars and restaurants if young Italians were paid how they pay them here with the holidays and protections that are here and with the ease of intake and dismissal that we have no Italian boy here would be with his hands for Roberto the market of the Italian work is unbalanced salaries are low c is too much wage difference between workers and managers This creates social envy and undermines cohesion in Iceland despite not lacking the scandals of foreign workers exploited and underpaid you are not afraid of losing the wallet forgetting the door of the house or open car because the crime rate is very low any work in the work in the Most cases explain Roberto allows you to make the weekends in Tenerife or London and buy an iPhone the hypothesis of the return to Italy at the moment C is but only for the holidays I moved to Iceland because I fell in love with the country but many want to move only Because in Italy they do not see any future if they have to find a humble job of falling back, it might be worth doing it in a country like this that allows you to make a dignified life
The story of Giulio and Chiara lies all in this phrase we decided to try to experience abroad any place would have been better than Italy he deals with sculpture painting and artistic installations she after having concluded a master's degree on the cuisine at the Luiss in Rome has received proposals from numerous galleries and cultural centers today Giulio Giustini 37 years from Sansepolcro and his partner Chiara Vignudelli 32 years from Rome live and work in Berlin Germany protects creatives by facilitating them in healthcare costs and guaranteeing their pension without paying the contributions here believe in the Artists and in their wealth contribution to the country tell in Italy art is considered a hobby for rich not a job the first time they left Italy was on August 29, 2015 just over three years ago we had the desire to open our horizons In the working field then we realized that the mountain was not so insurmountable remember G Iulio was enough for a week in Berlin to understand that perhaps the future was abroad after a few days in the city we managed to give life to an independent creative project that could economically support us a real job life in Berlin we found ourselves quite well From the start they tell the two artists we noticed several positive details both in the working and human field, the Berliners if they can help you certainly do not hold back this is a city that knows how to do community without the individualism of us Italians and I am adapting to the work Methods of typically Nordic approach and firmly I believe that working 3 4 hours a day is the best and more productive thing explains Giulio in short, but well here the concessions for those like me who want to open a startup are remarkable if we talk about rights benefits from transport here are the differences they are remarkable compared to Italy continues Giulio here facilitates them for those like me who wants to open a startup are remarkable and still impeccable transport the possibility of moving by bike with a cycle path that extends throughout the city network the car sharing the scooter sharing the bike sharing that allows you to live in total absence Of a car owned with a considerable savings, the greatest difficulty for Giulio and Chiara was facing a conversation in a language like German as complex and far from our way of communicating but helped us the English spoken flowing from many people in Berlin fluently It was not easy then to go to the city the first winter with the light that was already going away from the early hours of the afternoon you had the feeling that after lunch the day ended the goal of Giulio and Chiara is to stay in Germany for now we have given ourselves To be done since the beginning in creating something of our own an independent project that merged art and design the laboratory h To take the name of Urban Olive Design and in these three years it has expanded even beyond Berlin with professionally satisfying results if we talk about bureaucracy here we are in another world Germany gives you the opportunity to open a small activity in a bureaucratically slender way without facing Initially a taxation explains Giulio in addition, we have returned to the Kstlersoialkasse a social fund for the artists, in short, the state protects the creatives by facilitating them in healthcare costs and guaranteeing their pension without paying the contributions because it believes in the artists and in their contribution to their country we have decided to Get our child here to make him grow in a place where meritocracy and sense of justice exist and Italy the goal for now is to manage to channel almost totally the work on the web, thus being able to live in any part of the world only thanks to a computer and a laboratory look at your country from abroad means having a clearer clear vision with strengths and weaknesses means getting to know each other more and the better they tell the two the most beautiful moment for Giulio and Chiara was finding in the hole of letters the recognition from the state of work thus returning to the Cassa Artisti we decided to Get our son born here to grow up in a place where they exist meritocracy and a sense of justice tell if there is a term that best represents Berlin is definitely tolerance in Italy instead we should start all over again, you should give space to young people support those who make children focus on culture In short, we should talk about politics about politics and we no longer want to

Also this year, Italian researchers detach colleagues from other European countries and in the ranking of the European Council for ERC research bags come to second place exceeded only by the Germans, however, the problem, however, is that only 13 of the 35 rewarded compatriots makes research in our country therefore Many funding will end abroad an element that is a constant and that in 2016 the year in which almost half of the Italian winners 17 out of 30 did abroad research had turned into political controversy, the then Minister of Education Stefania Giannini had in fact rejoiced on Facebook a Another excellent news for Italian research we are in third place in Europe together with France first for the number of women women the response of one of the winning researchers Roberta D Alessandro had become viral dear Minister your hands from my merits had replied in a post on Facebook And to IlFattoquotidiano it had explained why I don't do I was part of the Italian research and not by my will from Italy, I was expelled to the competitions I never won and I only got the compliments of the commission among the Italian winners for the interprets, those who will carry out their research in our country are Elisabetta Baracchini of the Gran Sasso Science Institute GSSI and of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics Infn Niccol Bolli of the University of Milan Chiara Cappelli of the School Normal School of Pisa Ugo from the Lake of the University of Bologna Stefano Favaro of the University of Turin Massimiliano Fiorini of the Infns Giulia Giannini of the University of Bergamo Massimo Leone of the University of Turin Francesco Ricci of the University of Rome Tor Vergata Lorenzo Rosasco of the University of Genoa Francesco Scotognella of the Polytechnic of Milan Alberto Sesana of the University of Milan Bicocca and Giuseppe Vicidomini of the Italian Institute of IIT technology what the winners will do There were 2 389 the proposals assessed only about 12 will be financed the 32 of the winners are women for Carlos Moedas European Commissioner for research science and innovation these bags provide fuel to research and innovation in Europe because they give scientists the opportunity to take some Risks and pursuing their best and most crazy ideas added the next deadline to submit an application for the subsequent ERCs is set on February 7, 2019, the 291 winners of 40 countries will carry out the projects in universities and research centers of 21 European countries above all Great Britain with 55 projects Germany with 38 France with 32 and Switzerland with 29 the projects in Italy will be 15 of which two of foreigners are the most awarded with 49 ERC bags range from the study of salary inequality to the protection of refugees in Europe Central Eastern Center from quantum encryption to the origin of life from the movement of robots B Hypedi to augmented reality to manipulate holograms as if they were real objects project this latter coordinated by the Italian Antonio Ambrosio at the Iberian Nanotechnology Iberian laboratory in Portugal what the ERC I Grant are on average of 2 million euros each for a maximum of 5 years They are part of the European research and development program Horizon 2020 put together researchers of different areas to carry out multidisciplinary projects on the borders of knowledge for the president of the ERC Jean Pierre Bourguignon these bags will allow the most ambitious and creative scientists to put together or strengthen their own Research groups in Europe explained from the realization of an innovative tool for hunting for dark matter to astrophysics of black holes from biosensors for the study of genetic diseases to research on a rare blood pathology up to machine learning are some European projects thatThey involve Italian researchers and institutes
 In Italy my project was not even considered to be told that with an online magazine I would not have made its way unless I followed the political tracks so Filippo Baglini 44 years of Pietrasantino a degree with honors in nuclear physics at the University of Pisa and a job at CERN of Geneva on the accelerators of particles ten years ago he left everything and flew to London to realize his dream to live on journalism today his communication company founded at the cost of a pound boasts a site and a radio produces documentaries such as the one on Guglielmo Marconi And it provides content to the BBC in Italy I return only to find my mother explains Filippo who told his story also in the documentary Faredio Italia I will not return after graduation with honors in nuclear physics in 2003 Filippo finds work at CERN in Geneva I was included in the projects of Particles accelerators at the time in the development phase those that in 2012 would be served at Scop Rire the Higgs Bosone in Geneva Filippo realizes that I want to change my life he wants to be a scientific journalist at CERN and in the universities I came across people who knew very much about science but they did not know how to communicate but in Italy my project of an independent online magazine not There was not even considered in 2008 Filippo part for London city that has always fascinated him has a backpack some savings no contact London is not the golden is not the solution to economic problems but it is a place where if you cry a seed C it is the right land To make a plant grow while his colleagues are looking for the particle of God he works in a restaurant makes a bracket course becomes a laboratory technician in a school he does everything to keep himself during the apprenticeship in the newspapers until his company finally sees the company Light to open it enough a pound but the management costs are a very different matter I worked for 4 years From home because the prices of the offices were inaccessible every morning I tried to cut out two hours to go and look for Sponsor recalls the group today includes a site L ItaloEuropeo and a London One Radio that has been a supplier of the BBC for eight months a great satisfaction in the editorial office Filippo works with the students who come from various Italian universities to make an internship explains Filippo in Italy will not return but it is not all gold what glitters I call the other side of the London medal one of the defects of the great metropolis is the difficulty in relating to us between millions of people often feel alone and it is difficult to do friendships often find yourself talking about work only

When he was 25 years old Eleonora left Milan towards Scotland yes I had a stable job that I guarantee a good salary tells but I had decided to have an experience abroad learn English and specialize in courses in the wine sector who passed two years in Edinburg one day after having Received the offer of a restaurant Emiratino Eleonora Milanese case today 32 years old gave up everything to go to work and live in Dubai and there has opened a agency specialized in consultancy in the wine sector for private events ceremonies to return here you are much more free than what It can be imagined that his future was out of Italy understood it in 2013 on LinkedIn I specialized in the oenological field and opening the computer I received an offer as a sommelier in the Emirates at that moment it was clear to me that my path for this type Of the profession was only abroad of Dubai there is a lot of talk and in many ways at the end of It hangs from your work and from the people you meet explains Eleonora I have been here for 5 years and I happen to be in contact with many Europeans there are Italian friends who have lived here for 10 15 years I continue in the city coexist both Arabic and European the Arabs live in theirs Zone interfaces little with them is a very European environment what I frequent and only Italian women here are almost two thousand life in the city is always on the move by working as a freelance there is no day like the guard says the alarm then sounds then gym and meeting from 12 At 19 I often work from home Mando Mail I look at the curriculum meeting the restaurateurs to understand what is missing and how to improve the list of more wines there are private events where they ask us to manage everything especially during the weekend the differences that are missing The more a point dating is also a small bar under the house in Dubai there is no common meeting point as in Italy is not a c Inside where to walk the parks are missing as in Europe where maybe you find yourself bringing dogs there are not many cultural events there are not many museums to visit the story here is 30 40 years old the architecture is certainly wonderful there are splendid buildings but it is a city young without monuments mausoleums and churches of millennia ago in short, ancient history is missing but it is also nice to see that contemporary other important difference The bureaucracy is more streamlined than in Italy from this point of view here everything often becomes easier often private insurance takes care of each Detail things change, however, when it comes to flexibility, no it does not exist never close an eye to life in Dubai is expensive but for a very safe girl you are much more free than you imagine when you think of an Islamic country I can go where I also want at night explains Eleonora because there is safety in short, I'm very happy I would not change their seat If you respect the rules, you find you well return Eleonora confesses to be very close to Italy every time I come back to me my heart says the problem, however, it is that when you start working abroad you understand that there are cheaper and more advantageous places also within the Europe itself realize that there are countries where you can retire by paying half of the taxes as it happens in Portugal, for example, smiles Eleonora would like to return but taxes on one side and a bureaucracy so complicated by the other make me pass all the desire what He should change in Italy and because many young people are forced to go away every year Eleonora prefers to respond by speaking of his sector I would change the hospitality we are a country much loved by tourists but often we do not take care of them as they deserve it would be necessary to pamper them explains why tourism is also a source of I work then there are the cleaning of the roads and the theme politics on which abroad they always make fun of us but these are other factors for me Italy remains the best country in the world if I had a good economic possibility I would consider it but does not conclude today in 10 years

When he was 18 Felice managed to enroll in the Federico II University of Naples Faculty of Political Sciences, mine was a family of workers and I wanted to be economically independent during the summer after the maturity I started working in a restaurant, managing to put aside money for Registration and for the first books he had not dealt with the winter season here without any notice and without any contract that protects you find yourself without work there were two ways to employ the last thousand euros left aside to keep forward with the studies Or investing them on a trip to London was so that I understood that my future was not in Italy today Felice Terracciano 24 years old from Pozzuoli lives and works in Kuwait where together with a sheikh he manages a brand of Neapolitan pizzerias we want to bring tradition throughout the Gulf Persico smiles Felice left Italy on February 3, 2014 and since then I have no longer returned I remember well And that day he tells I was sad because I had to leave my family behind my family but above all I understood that in Italy a young man does not know how to make his dreams come true I was ambitious and then I thought that perhaps I deserved anything else after an experience before In Greece and then in Holland Felice returns to London to manage a pizzeria of an English company for two years one day one day the sheikh Nasser AlsaBah came to taste pizza and I told me about his project I decided to try it I visited him in Naples to make you meet Our two cultures after a year of happy work has moved permanently to Kuwait City I immediately felt welcomed here, people are sociable and altruistic we want customers to feel in a small Naples from the Middle East together with Alsabah Felice is starting a brand linked to Neapolitan cuisine, he starts from Kuwait City with the goal of expanding in the main cities of the Middle East or Gni Mattino Felice finds himself in his pizzeria while my colleagues turn on the oven and prepare the room I am in the office to deal with the accounts of achieving the objectives of the data analysis I put in contact with different local suppliers Species from Neapolitan smiles when the turn begins They are there to help and manage the team we want customers to feel in a small Naples of the Middle East, life in Kuwait is very different from that in Italy also from an economic point of view here it is all simple because the government is very supporting its citizens Happy health care and school education explains, for example, all residents receive significant subsidies for petrol water and electricity, each family receives aid from the state in primary foods, the state provides for a loan for zero interest for weddings and mothers without a job they have the right to a salary by the government and here not You don't even pay for zero taxes for Felice Kuwait is the most democratic country of the Middle East and the liberal of the Gulf also accommodation and transport by law are paid by the company for which you work so you have the opportunity to put aside Much of the salary with one of the strongest currencies in the world I felt forced to leave because I was tired of the Italians and for now this young pizza chef Campano sees it with the eyes of a tourist and I like to look at it from this point of view says Returning one day maybe but as a happy entrepreneur it is clear on the point I have no intention of sharing my sweat with a system that has never helped me unlike the different countries where I have been to Kuwait people are an opening and altruism that I had never imagined finding in the Middle East tells and then there is one more reason to stay I'm going to become a dad I'm sure my figl I will grow here without taboos and doubts about his future of Italy is missing the affection of the family and Parma ham yes there is something that I would change my country the organization of school education I would like the state to invest in young people and that it was not satisfied with it I felt forced to leave a rotten system I concluded because I was tired of the Italians without limited horizons that complain but prefer stars sitting for hours to drink coffee without worrying about the future
 We Italians always reproach us for being mammons but with a thousand euros a month as you do to live alone Silvia Ronchi for just over two years live in Basel on the Swiss border between France and Germany the common places on Italians make her angry with a Research allowance of 5 thousand francs per month at 26 years old has been able to obtain economic independence that many of his colleagues in Italy is not granted life in Switzerland it costs much more but we still talk about a quadruple salary respect for his compatriots a researcher in Italy is paid just over a thousand euros per month or even less if you have to pay 600 or 700 of rent as you do to keep your salary yourself has allowed her to travel but it is independence the greatest satisfaction is very nice not to be maintained by parents feel that your life belongs to you and you can manage it you can choose what to do and how in Italy it would have been impossible during a Dr. Orato here if you are good you do it in Italy it is not said there are economic crisis and a system spoiled by the recommendations in Basel arrived in 2016 to write the thesis I wanted to have an experience abroad and the Federal Institute of Technology was the best Option possible city that boasts in addition to the oldest University of Switzerland also an important industrial district of the pharmaceutical chemical sector L Eth L supported with a scholarship and then offered her to continue with a doctorate of research in neuroscience and electrophysiology in January Silvia She returned to Rome to discuss the thesis in February she started her new life in Basel His is an international research team with scientists from all over the world to meet people with different cultural luggage is a fortune especially at work you learn a lot from others The defect of the Italian University is to be too closed if it opened to other countries S It would have a much richer environment culturally and economically out of 40 researchers who work at his project ten are Italian which at the beginning filled it with pride until a colleague of mine explained to me that if many of our compatriots work here it does not mean that they are smarter than the Others but that with us is not work his colleague is one of the many researchers who arrived in Switzerland to complete their studies have never gone all would like to return to Italy explains Silvia but they are concerned about not finding work also in Switzerland the competition It is high but there are more opportunities often the large pharmaceutical companies think about taking physical chemists and engineers who cannot enter the academic world here if you are good you do it in Italy it is not said between the economic crisis and a system spoiled by the recommendations Those who are lucky becomes a 50 -year -old professor according to the last census of 2016 of the Anagr AFE of Italians residing abroad are over 600 thousand Italian citizens residing in Switzerland the third more large and German and German expat community to attract arms and brains is not only a greater availability of work but its quality workers' rights come Part time really protected is flexible parental leave work and non -paid extraordinary simply do not exist and then obviously there is a better quality of life when you go out of work you really enjoy free time no one works on Sundays all go to the park with children They are with the family or sports the rights of workers are truly protected, the part time is flexible in Basel Silvia is happy and the enthusiasm keeps the nostalgia of the Belpaese distant also because it says smiling for now is around the corner even if the trains cost a lot to time itself is aware that the university environment So open and multicultural is a privileged place outside it is not always so many Italians have denounced situations of discrimination Switzerland is a bubble of those who bring work and brings money is always welcome to pragmatically concludes often not to have felt forced to leave has caught on the fly An opportunity that had presented to her but what she found in the Swiss university an open and stimulating respect for workers and a salary that allows her to be independent makes them very difficult to think of returning I love my country but when you start to Building a life abroad as you do to return
The criticism has repeatedly defined him one of the most representative Italian violinists of his generation was awarded at the Vittorio Veneto Biennial Competition in 2010 and at the XX International Violinistic Postacchini Competition in Fermo sounds with a precious Joseph Guarneri tool of 1727 belonging to the violinist Cesare Barison For the kind concession of the family, he performed all over the world between music festivals and concerts for numerous prestigious institutions he is called Fabrizio Falasca is originally from Sarno and since 2016 he has been Assistant Concertmaster of the prestigious Philharmonia Orchestra of London many musicians including me not finding much space In Italy they made the painful decision to go abroad tells Fabrizio studied and trained in Italy by collaborating with numerous and prestigious orchestras from that of the San Carlo Theater in Naples at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome then moved by the desire to obtain greater gratifications p Rofessionals gained the idea of ??getting involved in other contexts also foreign to 2015 Fabrizio had already obtained the Master of Arts at the Royal Academy of Music in London in February 2016 in the same week the victory of the Concertmaster competition at the Orchestra arrives of Innsbruck and the victory as Assistant Concertmaster at Philharmonia Orchestra has been a complicated choice it is never easy to leave your land at the end of the optai for London the welcome of Philharmonia was special how to work in a large family of artists the relationships are professional marked by the human growth in a context of the highest level explains Fabrizio immediately showed that they believed in me the place of Fabrizio had remained vacant in the previous seven years because no one was able to satisfy the parameters required after the auditions in fact obtained the trial period could also want to be years for be confirmed here we proceed according to extremely hard and selective rules, the musicians are selected taking into account their potential and musical and human skills and how much the level and prestige of the orchestra can enhance the life of a musician is constantly evolving and every day is Different from another I do not have a real day type when I am in London the work rhythms are tight and frenetic the commitment is remarkable and stimulating the diversity and the amount of programs to be performed is vast more there are continuous international tours and concerts In different cities in the country Fabrizio carries out both solo activities and chamber music I dedicate most of my days to the study given the multiple nature of my business I have to face and prepare new repertoires in the United Kingdom explains Fabrizio always aims at the excellence in each working field and C is less preconceived in general the opportunities are d to all with respect and more flexibility then it is up to you to know how to exploit them continuous there are never professional realization and career limits but there is also to say that the competition is so much and ruthless from a remuneration point of view, the system is completely different from Italy and diversifies itself in relation to the commitments divided between services and concerts undertaken day after day and not with a fixed salary of course London has a cost not comparable to that of Italian cities therefore the salaries especially for musicians who play a role of great responsibility are adequate At the cost of life and Italy Fabrizio dreams of returning one day to be able to convey to children and colleagues younger the passion for music thanks also to the accumulated experience by shooting the world for me to emigrate should mean only cultural enrichment and musical growth continues sometimes I have l impression that in our country of art it can be done King without now for now London remains one of the most important musical panoramas in the world Fabrizio plays with Philharmonia has formed a string quartet performs in the major concert seasons around the world and collaborates as the first shoulder violin with the most prestigious orchestras of Europe I am southern I have a visceral relationship with my land and I often feel the need to return but I do not give up my goals one of the most beautiful moments was February 5, 2017 when Fabrizio performed as a soloist on the day of memory accompanied by Philharmonia in Royal London Hall Festival the room was sold out and during that thick applause I felt so proud to be Italian here I would like to see one Italy one day that gave more opportunities and did not let her talents leave
C is a corner of the United Kingdom where year after year, a generation of Italian researchers is finding refuge, we are in Bristol in the South West of England progressive and teeming city of multicultural center where Brexit in June 2016 did not get the better of the votes of the residents Here in the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs of the University of Bristol we live the strange but not too coincidence in which a substantial nucleus of Italian researchers for ten years now has been working side by side by exploring pioneering fields of science in recent years the number of graduates who end up doing Research in other countries has increased so much it is true that joking but not too much there is talk of an Italian colonization of abroad research tells Stefano Paesani 26 year old Roman in the third year of doctoral to Bristol to give an example in all the research centers that I have visited so far There was at least one Italian and in England there are research groups trained here He exclusively from Italians next to him Antonio Andrea Gentile 31 -year -old from Brindisi also PhD while Raffaele Santagati 37 years is a postdoc senior born in Termini Imerese in Palermo all three work at the Quantum Engineering Technology Labs and their study field is quantum simulation That is, how to simulate complex systems with exactly quantum properties using photonic chips potentially higher than classic computers in all the research centers that I have visited so far was at least an Italian but what is the importance of what they themselves call the first generation of Italians in Bristol The Bristol group was absolutely among the pioneers of the photonic chip technology in the quantum field demonstrating the manipulation of light particles for the first time, photons in photonic microchips specify the three researchers their colleagues are scientists of Microsoft and Google publish studies For the most established magazines such as L UL Thyme job they signed on Science Advances would be wondered if there is a common matrix in the path that catalyzed many at the moment about a dozen Italian researchers in the same English department meanwhile the speed in the bureaucratic procedure in starting a path here tells Antonio that like Stefano He moved to Bristol three years ago because the fast timing especially in our sector are fundamental then in the English environments you can breathe that respect for the academic figure that is partly losing in small Italy was certainly not the pay to attract us continues Raffaele who He started his English experience in 2012 but the availability of dignified positions as well as the domino effect in seeing other Italians succeed in their own field, it should also not be forgotten that Italian universities provide excellent preparation making Italian candidates very attractive closes the 37 -year -old Sici closes Liano therefore not only Bristol attracts us Italians but we Italians dock Bristol L Italia should be good as other countries like China do to facilitate the return of researchers an army of resources that could represent enormous potential for Italy in fact the vast majority of researchers that I met they have the desire to return home tells Raffaele Santagati demonstrating how little would be enough to trigger the return of a good part of the academics, Italy should be good as other countries like China do to take advantage of it by facilitating the return of the researchers instead of boiling it like fugitives and launching into easy nationalisms Stefano and Antonio in Mexico, for example, finance PhD bags with the obligation to spend periods of research at home after the end of the studies should be the perspective when we see some compatriot to do the suitcases of Italy d Elle discussions to Antonio Gentile even if there are Italian enough Italian here in Bristol not to be missing too much there are those small details such as the warmth and sincerity of the people who so speechless when I was in Italy and so much I miss now that I am in England continues Stefano C is those who conclude that Italy is the perfect place for retirement smiles Antonio Sinca pension is a myth and Italy a complex country the only recipe then it is not tired of trying to improve it

 After almost five years here in Dublin it is difficult to remember why I left Italy the reasons are always blurred by the memory of the good food of the walks at the beach in the evening and by the sun of Sicily but to think about it the list was very long Simone Caruso is 33 years old And comes from Messina works as a software developer in the Irish capital after trying without success to make a career in Italy here I found a more favorable environment for the team working and a strong sense of meritocracy says from us the concepts of career and personal technical growth are Non -existent and there is no interest in the quality of the product in the third year of computer studies in Messina tells had been selected by a Sicilian company for a research project I did not have a penny and the family situation was difficult so I took the opportunity to flight to leave the house despite the encouraging premises, however, the experience proves to be a disappointment. A mediocre both from a cultural point of view and from the technical one I feel I have thrown away two years in which I suspended my studies and I started to understand what the level of computer engineering in Italy is at least I had become independent to go back to studying and living in Family after a long time away for Simone was an unbearable perspective so he found another job this time in Rome I lived there two more years and then in that case I lost the reasons the group I worked for was very important to make IT consultancy for adults Multinationals, however, gave me 1 500 euros per month while my work was contracted to client companies for 500 euros per day or more after a while this situation started to disturb myself so I gave up the last attempt to find your way at home Simone He did it in his Sicily together with former companions of studies in the meantime who became engineers we had decided To start on our own we were in 2010 in full crisis bad idea to start a company naively, however, we thought we could do it by having a good number of customers and projects not even two months and we were already forced to drag a customer before the judge because he did not pay I discovered that in Sicily this is a very widespread practice, companies do not pay by exploiting the biblical times of justice we do not talk about the quality of the innovation of attention to detail all things that no one drew anything to anyone and so another time stressed by the economic difficulties and the rudeness of the Customers I was forced to raise the white flag is only then at almost 30 years old who decides to look for work abroad I was tired of being exploited remember in just two weeks two offers come one from Germany and one from Dublin I chose to live here because I have Found a small city for men's size where I could have lived if nza use the car and without too much stress I am an employee of an American multinational salary and career prospects are excellent software development for the management of human resources useful programs for companies to keep the invoices under control customers the supplies but the only place in which it continues To feel at home is Sicily when I go home for the holidays every time I find my family different so much is the time that passes without seeing it I always thought that one day I would like to go back to Italy but I no longer want to work on the conditions I lived before to depart

Steel City where his girlfriend just moved for the master's degree I took him as an adventure instead Giulia was very worried because at the time not I was talking about an English word despite this thanks to word of mouth, the first work immediately reaches washerwashing in an Italian restaurant in the meantime distributes curriculum to the temporary agencies and after a few months he calls him a steel manufacturing factory I did not hope I had little experience only a few jobs on commission and a two -month internship confesses to Italy I would never be to called by a company so mutua it almost does not exist I am forced to work even if I could not raise weight Andrea now lives and works in Sheffield for almost three years has been building cylindrical steel cages of enormous size and the weight of various tons that stabilize the foundations Of great buildings, if you ask him to take stock of his experience he replies with difficulty there are very positive aspects and others very negative we start from the worst thing after two and a half years I still have an interim contract in January they said that in June they would have me Hiring then they continued to postpone I have no protection they are blackmailed and fired at any time with a notice of a few hours in the moments when there was less work I saw colleagues dismissed in the trunk with a simple phone call from Marxist convinced is struggling to accept the situation I hope that in Italy we never reach this level of precariousness and exploitm Ento even if it admits here the fixed place is not a dogma people suffer less the change and the arrival of technology tells for many it has meant losing their place a robot does the work of five workers I was lucky I learned to maneuver the robots they produce In Italy and I kept the place indeed I had an increase in salary but the purchase of two robots meant 16 layoffs when it could have been reduced by working hours to the same salary for everyone even if the place c is still welfare is almost Null I had to go to work even with an inflammation in my back diagnosed by the doctor who prevents me from lifting weights this because although I was hurt in the workplace the mutual is very small for a week of illness I received 90 pounds but attention to security At work it is a serious thing the Italian ones have not died white but murderer the aspect for which he would never leave England, on the other hand, is the culture of safety at work is a cool debut there is another attention and a completely different mentality before coming here I did not imagine that you could do my job with this level of security you should talk about it in Italy and maybe take Example the deaths at work in most cases have not died white but murderer from us, the safety is seen as a stuff as a girl not only in the workplace but also at home or on the street those who put a plant in accordance with the belt or respects the speed limits it almost always does it unwillingly and only to avoid checks and fines and so workers and bricklayers do not use the helmet because it is uncomfortable and continuous once when I worked in Italy it ended up a chipper of steel in the eye and I had to Going to the hospital to make it removed they told me it was a necessary evil that it could happen arrived here I discovered that it is not affected Act that can be avoided with simple measures, however, specifies the same Italian rules on safety at work are ridiculous here we observe in a way to pedishase rules that in Italy even exist and often are banality

 I was in Colombia on a holiday of a family friend one evening in an Italian restaurant I see a wine of those who in Italy finds in any supermarket at 4 or 5 euros sold at 60 and more and I turn on a light bulb six years later Riccardo Trentini 27 year old Genoese manages a company with 15 employees with two friends and a turnover of over half a million dollars, the Masters Milan is based in Bogota and is the greatest Italian wine importer in Colombia in Colombia, the European wine explains Riccardo has always been a niche product In South America here the wine is by definition Argentine or Chilean in 2012 when I arrived the first time the market share of Italy was less than 1 as a student at the second year of management at the Bocconi University tells the classmates of their fantasies because not Let's try to put on something in Colombia asks the closest friends the first container six thousand bottles if it had gone bad And we would go home at the beginning we laughed tells Danilo Marotta 35 years old from Salerno we knew nothing about the country and we had many prejudices like many Italians we thought of the drug trafficking and Pablo Escobar also thanks to the series and TV that tell the Colombia of the Trent Years Instead, the conditions of the cities and the economy have evolved very much I thought that Riccardo had gone mad or that he had fallen in love with some Colombian says Carlo Angius the third 30 year old partner of La Maddalena then I convinced myself but at the beginning he left as a game An experiment to see if we were capable and it worked maybe I have to thank someone up there because the first container that we got from Italy was like an all in on the game table remembers Riccardo were 6 thousand bottles if it had gone badly we would have returned home luckily we had chosen good wines we were good at handing them down quickly and explaining And their characteristics at the Bogota restaurateurs who had never seen them went very well the request was so high that we had to make an extraordinary expedition by air to not finish the stocks now Riccardo Danilo and Carlo have lived in Bogota for five years have taken fifteen All Colombian employees and supply over 400 restaurants and clubs in six cities Bogot Barranquilla Santa Marta Cartagena Cali and Medellin and in the capital they opened the first Italian products shop what they will always be grateful to Colombia say is the trust they warned around them Here no one has ever looked at us badly because we are young explains Danilo in Italy to be it is seen as a defect even in the most successful companies here instead is a factor that generates enthusiasm Riccardo confirms when I turned to the Italian producers to explain my idea I had 22 years and I had just come out of the university almost half he has me Filed the door in the face without even listening to me, luckily someone was more courageous and allowed us to leave I think they are not repentant but in Italy there is a quality of life that there is no elsewhere the three are sure that without emigrating they would never have Reached these results in Italy, the market is saturated there is confusion about taxation laws and we look with pessimism to the future says Riccardo here instead the general belief is that tomorrow the country will be better in very strong development thanks to the agreement between the Government and the Farc which has put an end to a conflict that lasted over fifty years many think of Colombia as an unstable country adds Carlo but the truth is that it has a more ancient republican tradition than Italy and in the last 40 years there has been no government that has fallen before of the natural end of the legislature after the pacification that yielded the Nobel Prize to President Juan Santos for the President Juan Santos for the peace in 2016, the political situation was further improved but for all three the long -term targets is to return to Italy there is a quality of life that does not exist elsewhere admits Riccardo even just having a coffee in any historic center puts you in peace with yourself and yet the climate is depressed the governments fall like leaves the reforms are dismantled from one year to another and it is impossible for one entrepreneur to program the long -term future but how I managed to bring a little Italy to Colombia so I would like to One day bringing the products of my adoptive country in what saw me born hoping not to find other doors closed in brackets Riccardo really fell in love with a Colombian is a catalina with whom she has lived for a year

 We are in 2018 the professional market is global and the Italian species especially mine will have to sooner or later make a reason Maurizio Bocca is 37 years old and comes from a small village on Lake Como Pescate has left Italy the first time on a direct plane From Malpensa to Oulu Nord of Finland was September 15, 2003 since then he has not returned today after a doctorate a DOC post in the USA and the hiring as a researcher at the Bosch Research Center to Paolo Alto California Maurizio is technical director in a Salt Lake company City in the Utah l Italy with us a recent graduate is forced to alms pseudo temporary contracts with much lower salaries explains or must pass through years of practiced working almost free of charge because after a degree in IT engineering at the Polytechnic of Milan Maurizio started in Erasmus for the Finland I wanted to learn English well remember I found myself catapulted into an AV environment CONTRUARY FOR TECHNOLOGY AND High Speed ??and Free Internet Organization throughout the Campus Infrastructure and Equipped Laboratories Courses with updated programs and young professors with whom you can have lunch and discuss at the end of a lesson at the Polytechnic was struggling to get even a smiles only The turning point due to the eruption of the volcano in Iceland blocked at the airport, I met a prof of the Utah is true the winter days in Finland spent two hours of light a day and 42  in February but without that experience between the German Spanish German Mexicans Australian Russian Australian And in short, my future would have been different one day during a game at Basket Maurizio knows a researcher who involves him in his project was so a bit by chance that I found myself face to face with Professor Heikki Koivo of Helsinki University of Technology I managed to show him my job and he became my superv Degree is at the end of Maurizio in Finland to work in his group for over six years in 2010 during a conference in Stockholm the other decisive moment we all stood at the airport due to the sudden eruption of the volcano in Iceland, I met Professor Neal Patwari of the University of Utah I invited him to dinner and in front of a plate of spaghetti even so good I talked to him about my ideas to be developed in the United States perhaps in a Post DOC Detto the following year in 2011 Maurizio is in Salt Lake City in Utah the first impact With America it was not easy, indeed a real cultural shock typical of the European championship that is suddenly found in the USA tells Maurizio here is all larger spaces roads portions of the restaurant including salaries the economic treatment abroad is certainly better than that Italian Maurizio had already experienced it in Finland in Helsinki where a recent graduate in Information Engineering immediately finds first employment indefinitely and with a salary of at least 55 thousand euros in the year 3 500 euros net per month in Italy instead is forced to alms pseudo contracts but on one point it is good to be clear it is not enough to live at Abroad, quality work and pagan professionalism I have worked for years with Finnish and Germans correct but precise and severe people in the judgment that leave nothing to chance and give nothing to anyone especially to the Italians to return Italy is a country in suffering Salt Lake City is comparable to a quiet Italian city city, life is less expensive chaotic and frenetic that in Silicon Valley Maurizio lives in an apartment in the center arrives in the office in his startup with a 10 -minute walk imagines to return one day the issue is not What do I imagine but rather what reality tells me the Italy is at this moment a country in Suffer Unfortunately, when you speak of remuneration of us everything collapses and discounts for the simple fact that I am Italian I am not willing to make it even if the situation linked to immigrant status in the USA is certainly not easy after a brilliant academic career a job as a researcher in Silicon Valley and now as technical director of a startup that is taking two Americans Maurizio is still dealing with the bureaucracy of immigration, his demand for Green Card is still in progress and this young Italian engineer started from Lake Como 15 years ago risks Losing practically the whole Trump administration has introduced new rules in the silence of the media and in general ignorance that make the process very slow and difficult to also explain for those with a curriculum like its own it has the impression that at this moment in the USA on the theme immigration He is shooting himself in the pile

suitcase here are some of their stories told in Valigiandicartone ilFare Gail Com are a London and the trouble of dreams is that they come true when I go back to Bari I see the faces of always a bit aged the same places only a little more ugly I was born Fortunato I grew up in southern Italy in a family that loved me and supported me every time That my failures were dried up energy and determination to me I am 31 years old and a life full of friendships who are fussy wins broken loves and scars and I feel them on all a wealthy family but who has known for life the value of the term sacrifice I was lucky to study to work to deepen what I studied to graduate with full votes with honors in architecture at Polyc Nico di Bari a faculty as promising as unjustly penalized whose only wrong has been for a long time to be able to see each other only with the eye of their Mediterranean roots I have no relatives in the construction sector I am the son of anyone and I have no recommendations I spent part of the My university career in being the representative of the students who slowed me and unimated me some teachers because I believed in the possible dialogue between the student struggle and the academic institution I gained the esteem of those who in the end repudiated me a few months after the degree the jump of Trusted the opportunity to work in Milan with some of the most prestigious realities in the sector for four years following projects and construction sites in Italy France Germany Qatar but the reality is that I was hungry and it was not enough I had a dream the dream one day to work a London and to be able to find the doors of Norman Foster open despite an neckq I went badly, however, I arrived in London where I work for another equally prestigious world signature that I feel honored every time I read of those who have often gone away I read words that arouse bitterness more than emotion my story my hunger does not arise from anger For unemployment from the category of architects in Italy, eternal VAT matches that work 17 hours a day abandoned by the state whose bureaucracy and slowness often ends up treating them only as ATMs to pay taxes even before having an income I saw reality that always have me paid punctually and promoted when I deserved it and personaggs exploiters of poor recent graduates too blinded by a context with difficult prospects to understand that their time and commitment has a value in Italy if you are smart and stubborn you can find your way excellence and pressing coexist in We fight is our nature at least as far as ingenuity and precarious The point is that in Italy you can live indeed for me it has always been hard to go away and feel like remaining wherever it was I did not feel the weight of a great renunciation for abroad for breakfast with American coffee rather than with the espresso not I am interested in the taboos of those who suffer the non -Italian diet of those who cry the gray of the sky rather than the sun and the beaches the small and fragile houses rather than the living rooms in stone the neurotic din of the large metropolis rather than long Sunday walks in the villages medieval C is a different priceless beauty in each of these things that strengthens even more in their contrast in my history c is so much joy but there is also a thinner suffering latent c is emotion when I find a beer back at home and a beer Panzerotto wrapped on the seafront of Bari and at the same time a profound annoyance for the voice that he says immediately eh where you find them in London c It is the beauty of finding your city that has adopted you and the annoyance in noting that it is always the same or rather removing some tree and putting some benches on the main road breaks citizens in two c is joy and pain in seeing your dear friends or relatives have a thousand lives to tell him in a few months that you have been away and see them listening to you undergoing passive properties as if you were a stranger and perhaps you are split in two lives that do not know each other advice between the detention and the frenetic race between past and future because going away means necessarily to escape from something because it seems so difficult to simply accept curiosity the desire to know the other the wanting to try to feel the other what must improve his English that does not know the laws that finds himself younger but better colleagues And with a more advanced career curiosity The unconsciousness The awareness of one's defects is what as a country has there F I act to win the greatest challenges and in this I feel more Italian than many of my compatriots who remain the greatest pain of having gone away from Italy for me is not the lack of food from the sun coffee of unemployment is something more alchemical General a sum of factors that are difficult to identify it is to discover that outside the world goes on it runs without stopping and your wonderful country is split in two of those who do it barefoot without shoes and often instead those who have shoes remain on the eyelash a Cleaning them instead of running is the anxiety of remaining still to get lost something important is the anguish of feeling alone in one's desire to comparison the fear of discovering yourself not competitive or not yet mature in many respects and the desire to discover it is the awareness that at the time The same place you come from is the country you learned that there is no thing that you cannot learn to challenge that you cannot win breath That you cannot develop you learned it there and you went away not to forget it I would have gone away even without the crisis even with exponential growth employment even without this cultural regression and alarming xenophobic to compare myself with other excellence to get out of my comfort zone for My insatiable obsession with constantly pushing myself beyond my limits to see how much my hunger was worth the investment of another country the resources the economies necessary to welcome me despite having to start all over again to go faster to find that in a few months you can pass from the necessary Pinking with your superiors to have to teach how to keep up with other people you are responsible for I would have left anyway to feel alone and therefore rediscover the true meaning of my origins to understand how much my willpower can bring me further and how much My Italian being played a role in all this for P to extend the price of leaving me vain friendships and broken loves but repaying me with friendships experiences and wonderful cultures in qatar France India Filipino Jordan England China because Italy is a beautiful country but it is simply the only one there are a thousand places and landscapes and stories in the world in which to leave a piece of your soul to live smell to taste sweating because I have the terror to stop but above all because only when you change the point of view on things your line dorizzonte is enriched I feel much more confused and out of place than before and Precisely for this reason I am convinced that I am doing very well I don't want to stop hungry but I want to stop being afraid of the other than the best of the best of the most difficult of discovering me as well as Italian citizen of the world but above all of being afraid of dreams because the trouble of dreams is that Nicola Boccadoro come true
The first time that Mario left Italy was five days after his degree in Law I decided to go to Switzerland and start from scratch remembers the most difficult thing was not to separate his small village of origin in Calabria to find an apartment In the Canton Argovia nor to refuse a candidate place to the municipal elections but to convince his family and above all his father of his choice when Dad had seen me the first humble works from the farmer to the cleaning services had told me that I was a crowd in a few months In Switzerland Mario case 28 years learned the German signed his first permanent contract in a transport company and today he was promoted by entering the administration of the company L Italia only false promises had tried Mario to get busy in his land ended Higher studies have founded a work cooperative tells more I have directed for over 6 years u Na historic Association very active in the area then the choice to go away I was 25 when I took my train to the north in my eyes the tiredness combined with the much enthusiasm for the future Switzerland has a well -defined character and has its angularness but the arrival In Switzerland it was not easy if on the one hand the bureaucracy reigns here is efficient and the care system is strong from the other people with frankness and sincerity love to maintain a certain distance Switzerland is in short a great country and its people albeit multi -ethnic It has a well -defined character and with its angularity the relationships almost always begin with prejudice but the time helps smiles Mario the day starts very early at 5 am I am already in the office tells Mario control the worktop coordinates the daily runs are in contact with couriers and vectors speak with them in more languages ??mario is proud of the gavetta helped me he says after three Months in Switzerland came the first permanent contract after a year and a half the promotion to coordinator no to be sincere I have never felt forced to emigrate responds to mine is a story that has been built step by step Switzerland but not so not Perfect as many believe is simply different from Italy with higher salaries and deep quality services and administrative efficiency at every level and still little corruption more security a more participatory democracy and training courses that have direct and concrete connections with the world of work Italy for Mario continues to be besieged by false promises that destroy the sense of a future perspective his generation in short, he was forced to leave when he wanted to deal with a meritocratic system or focusing on competitions that are not theaters in which the role of protagonist actors belongs to recommended that Aliment The usual Italian clientele system we young forced to leave when we wanted to deal with a meritocratic system that was never known, it is not true that it is true that you have to balance the concrete opportunities and the values ??in play in recent weeks a group of young friends and Former administrators asked Mario to return from Switzerland to represent the ideal synthesis of a new political project in view of the next electoral rounds would be a nice way to be able to contribute with greater experience to the progress of my community and my land I am thinking about it confesses Mario And often he recalls with the smile how long it has been long and difficult to learn other languages ??keep the objectives without giving up staying away from home but being emigrating today means making a much more rational choice than the generations that preceded us have reduced themselves Communications are increasingly easy In short, in short, the sense of abandonment and solitude in Italy is no a sense of boredom nothing happens and nothing ever changes is as if the new generations felt cheated, just think that they still do not respond to those who send curricula jobs are obtained according to belonging and without meritocracy if you want to start again you need the right mentality measured and competent people, in short, it is necessary to transform the concept of mythological legend meritocracy to wonderful reality

Produce an alternative to animal meat to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the gas farms that represent almost 15 of the total emissions produced by the man Giuseppe Scionti Biioingegniera Italiano 31 -year -old and doctor in Biomedicine who has been a professor and researcher for three years at the Polycine University of the Catalonia Upc in Barcelona made it invented and patented a technology that allows you to produce vegetable meat with the consistency and nutritional properties of the animal one using only natural ingredients not of animal origin and a special 3D printer the method developed by Scionti shown for the first time at the conference organized by the Barcelona biomedical engineering for the Biomedical Engineering, it combines the avant -garde knowledge of tissue engineering and biostampa with modern gastronomic strategies by creating a hi tech system capable of generating food with high protein content and fibrous aspect pr Operio as the meat the project was born from my personal challenge while I was working in Barcelona and the first prototype of vegetable meat was created using a 3D printer adapted then specifically for me by the CIM UPC technological institute explains Giuseppe who in 2014 published how CO Author a patent for the development of smart biomaterials containing magnetic nanoparticles and the following year he was elected judge for the innovators under 35 prizes organized annually by the MIT of Boston, nature does not form animal fabrics only to be eaten but forms them so that they can have the function to make animals live and move when trying to generate meat in the laboratory starting from animal cellular crops aims to obtain a real muscle in a sterile sciondi environment, however, think that producing a muscle that can contract and work as a real animal muscle requires A much larger economic and environmental energy consumption than that or that serves to create a meat with flavor consistency and nutritional properties equal to the real ones, nature does not form animal fabrics only to be eaten supports the researcher but forms them so that they can have the function of making animals live and move produce meat only for Being eaten is a fundamental paradigm change that will allow you to spend less planetary resources, the patent will be used not only to create an alternative to animal meat with benefits on the environment but to counter the lack of amino acids essential minerals and vitamins necessary for a balanced diet In this initial phase of development it is possible to produce 100 grams of meat in half an hour at the cost of two euros but the patent is designed to be able to adapt to a large -scale industrial process that allows you to reduce both manufacturing times and costs of 10 times L invention can also be used for the nutritional content of the imcentrs consumed in the rural regions of the planet, the foods produced through this technology explains Scionti can be pasteurized and packaged to be stored and transported in unmichiable areas that also due to the long journeys, little lend themselves to the correct conservation of the food and we are also evaluating the possibility to incorporate specific drugs to foods produced to be of help also in those areas of the world where endemic diseases are present, cattle uses 30 of all the cultivable land and beyond 25 of the planet's fresh water the most recent relationships of the FAO show that the large -scale breeding is no longer sustainable on a global level to obtain the same amount of calories from food, for example, cows breeding requires seventy more vast soil than what would be needed by growing fruit and vegetables in addition, cattle uses 30 of the whole cultivable land and beyond On the 25th of the fresh water of the planet, evaluating the growth trend of the world population in the next thirty years, we come to the conclusion that if we continue with the current system in the future there will be little possibilities to have the resources to distribute food to all for this concludes Scionti that Finding another way of producing healthy economic food that contains all the fundamental nutrients will be able to better manage the food resources of our planet globally for the development of the first alternative meat models has met with some of the most important chefs and restaurants in the world and three Michelin stars holders such as Ferran Adri creator of molecular cuisine and Celler de Can Roca voted as the best restaurant in the world in 2013 and 2015 in these days is bringing together a team of experts in the sectors of the gastronomy nutrition and industry of the food to found a startup and bring this project to a higher level that can contribute to transforming the traditional way of producing already unsustainable meat at a global level and at the same time helping to distribute healthy food in the less rich areas of the planet

When you ask him what it means to be emigrant Ciro sighs then smiles means sacrifice difficulties moments of despair means missing your family, however, at the same time it means being incredibly proud of their origins and making it an added value Ciro Pirone is 42 years old is from Salerno and lives in Boston for almost 20 years the first time he left Italy was immediately after the high school towards London I wanted to have my experiences improve my English and to form in the sector in which I had studied today is responsible for the portfolio of numerous companies Italian wine in the USA and says my American dream yes it is come true when Ciro was not starting from Italy after a diploma in a hotel institute the first experiences in London the apprenticeship between Sardinia and Amalfi coast I had a lot of desire to learn remember continuously travel For work between Infin days Ite interviews after hours of interminable train that extending tourist seasons in 1999 so the choice to try the road to America in Boston I found a second cosmopolitan but very European city house tells even if not everything was smooth as one might think about the moments There were many solitude of solitude, they could not return to Italy for over 5 years until I got the green card and later on American citizenship today Ciro works as a sector manager for a large wine distribution company in New England are often around I do Many kilometers visited customers I do everything to educate restaurateurs to the excellence of Italian wine differences with Italy primarily the innate civic sense by passing from respect for the public and nature to spasmodic attachment for the flag to return would mean throwing in the wind all without any guarantee And then I don't see a future for my children and costs There are also advantages from an economic point of view, we live in Boston in the state of Massachusetts one of the richest and early avant -garde for hospitals schools and services, however, nothing is given here explains Ciro at the same time adds there is also another America that of poor trades e Of the very low salaries that forces you to live in difficulty many Americans the level of productivity required is very high you can grow enormously in a short period if you are seriously committed to you, in short, you are based on the continuous meritocracy Ciro does not matter how much little experience you can have all Start or the poor mastery of the language The Americans believe in human value and they give you confidence is then to you do well and realize your dream The family of Ciro today is in Boston married to Ann and father of two children Marcello 6 years and Valentina Di 4 with which he speaks exclusively in Italian so that they can feel proud of the PR Opere origins and evaluating in the future an experience in Italy to return to Salerno for now is not an option contemplated here I feel in debt with the many people who have helped me to become what I am today I hope to continue growing in the world of wine C is A huge continuous margin we come to Italy on vacation but to return definitively it would mean throwing everything without any guarantee to the wind and then I don't see a future for my children if you have any possibilities you have to go looking for where they are offered thanks to her work Ciro He feels proudly Italian tells the stories of many compatriots who are busy producing and defending Made in Italy in the world more than a defender feels like an ambassador of the tricolor is sometimes true dreamy romantically dreams of returning then seeing what happens in mine country I realize that I could never give up on meritocracy and the possibility of realizing my dreams without asking re favori or someone permission to someone and wants to clarify a thing not are not one of those who tell everyone to escape from their country but if you have any possibilities you have to go to look for where you are offered in Italy there is too much corruption Too much desire to keep things in a stagnant condition and the politics of the last twenty years he concludes has made that being smarter means being more intelligent, it is not so I don't forget the sacrifices made
meritocracy trust in young possibilities of making a career within the university without having to compromise and above all without long years of gavetta for free or almost is what Claudio Formicola 39 years and a degree in industrial design found overseas in Mexico to thousands of kilometers away from where the university career in Italy had started in Italy was impossible and in practice it never started tells in Mexico instead in a few years I became a professor in one of the most prestigious universities with the possibility and resources to develop projects And to best carry out my work for Claudio as for many other colleagues everything begins after the master's degree originally from Marcianise in the province of Caserta who came out of the faculty of architecture after studies in industrial design begins to teach as a contract teacher in some universities including including The second university of Napol The universities of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli La Sapienza of Rome and Federico II of Naples, however, what found is not what was expected to contract teachers a ridiculous economic treatment was reserved explains my first teaching was paid 500 euros including contributions for A semi -annual course in addition to the lessons that I had to keep C were obviously the talks with the students and the exam sessions an immense commitment compared to the salary offered but the other times it does not go better with the excuse that I was a graduate some proposals provided for free contracts to the I started working as a designer so I could afford to invest, however, I could not continue like this with the excuse that I was a graduate some proposals provided for free contracts soon Claudio leaves the teaching to start a doctorate without a scholarship but also here are the obstacles before get there I had to try three times he told me No that there was no room or career possibility once a few days before the competition had been explicitly told me not to introduce myself because evidently the place was already assigned the problems but there is no shortage of even once the doctorate without a scholarship is not there Formally the obligation to present themselves to the university but in the practice those who do not do it are marginalized for them if I was at home meant having one less person who works for free and this has always been a reason for clash with the direction so after three years Claudio leaves too The doctorate and with it the university career in Italy we are a world on the contrary the old barons are the masters of the universities and they decide the beautiful and bad weather one of these offered me the honor of working for free for him to make a career said to my refusal to me He said I was a stupid that I was throwing a great opportunity naturally that day my doors closed in my University then in 2010 arrives at that time Claudio collaborates for an important studio in Milan for which he manages an exchange project with students from Tecnolgia De Monterrey one of the most prestigious universities of Mexico who came to experience Made in Italy All Start the designer is invited for a promotion tour to keep some masterclasses in the various university campus then in 2013 the call for the role of International Distinguished Professor of Design tired of the situation here in Italy I accepted the initial proposal was for the role of An useless semester to say that I am still here I work in one of the most prestigious universities I have resources and autonomy that in Italy I could only dream here you are seen how a resource are entrusted with important assignments opportunities to grow and earnings that I have never seen at home but It is not only the economic treatment that is more Vantagg I what Italy is given space here to young people to make a career is certainly not easy but C is meritocracy I have reached 33 years and the director of my department had 28 in Italy in most cases at 40 you are not yet professor in these yet years Claudio has been a teacher now he became responsible for innovative study programs between Italy and Mexico and every year in summer he accompanies his Mexican students in Italy by collaborating them with our design companies the link with Italy remains for me it is difficult to detach from my country I suffer from it and makes me angry concludes to return I would like it so much but I don't think about the current conditions I would have many possibilities
 It is foolish to be not prepared for extreme events caused by climate change and yet in Italy one of the countries most at risk in Europe the debate has practically disappeared when Valentina Barletta Geophysics of the Technical University of Denmark has published the results of her study that could help prevent or delaying the collapse of the western antarctic polar cap inside the prestigious Science magazine, many journalists have called it Dutch English Americans, some Germans no Italians the Italy I go back only for the Christmas holidays not more In 2004 at the University of Milan he understood that his future was abroad at a precise moment when the judges of the TAR issued a ridiculous sentence against us precarious researchers who protested against the umpteenth competition made up there I definitively lost confidence in the Italian institutions remembers later have g It is so much for work between the United States and Europe Valentina in 2011 he decided to move to Denmark by accepting the Danish Nasa Du Space a fixed -term place the Danish have welcomed me well tells here is not easy but it is certainly a walk compared to our life Previous in Italy the arrival in the office by public transport the sea the colors of the city the green the main difference is that here I breathe much better and practically I don't suffer anymore of asthma tells Valentina when I lived in Milan I had the feeling of being in one Gray and sad city here is all colorful full of parks and children who play even seeing them raises you the Copenhagen spirit is to measure from men there are low buildings and small supermarkets in each neighborhood the public transport work well the cycle paths are everywhere and everywhere and Traffic is scarce but not for the Danish people's priority is not to earn but live well Here I breathe much better and practically I no longer suffer from asthma of the public sector you can trust even if sometimes the Danish are messes in Italy on the contrary grow with the idea that anyone who is always ready to screw yourself especially the public administrators continues Valentina the feeling is That there are much less clumsy and many more smart costs, then so different it is clear that if you come on vacation in Denmark the prices rise a lot but live there is another thing here as a post doc you get to three thousand euros net per month l Rent in the center costs less than a thousand euros and I could also pay the mortgage in Milan I could hope for 1 300 euros and with those I don't live when in Italy with my precarious contract I asked for a mortgage in the bank did not offer me even a coffee watch Italy from Denmark is sometimes disconcerting are no longer updated on the academic situation when I left it the worst problem was No the barons and all those who defend them well if those are still there then there is not much to discuss the continuous movement of brains is a certain resource but only in the continuous learning phase Valentina when you reach 30 and you are forced to move continuously abroad you cannot take root to have a family like in my case the young people who want to travel the world in short they do very well to move and to have different experiences then at a certain point it is better to stop thinking about a stable future but this for the most part It is impossible the feeling is that in Italy there are much less clumsy and many more clever the most correct question would be like doing to attract foreign talents first to learn English smiles Valentina then adapt the services to increase wages and career prospects and yet there are several researchers and Italian workers respected and estimated in Denmark but everything passes in silence Completely obscured by the Italian politics Valentina confesses that she has gradually disammuted the researcher's work if in reality she has to spend the 90 of her time to make other types of funds and the situation of scientific research in Europe is not as rosy as the future might appear is At 90 in Denmark with the aim of continuing the research work for Valentina these days with the air of xenophobia that pulls throughout Europe being emigrant is quite unnerving and feeling slogans of the type steal the work by my compatriots really does really do angry after everything that has passed Valentina does not want to go back to living in Italy nor to work just thinking about it concludes me the chills come to me
 I put it all to stay in Italy but our academic system is too closed Filippo Sposini PhD student in philosophy of science at the University of Toronto cannot hide a veil of bitterness originally from the province of Perugia after the maturity moved to the North East to attend the Faculty of Psychology but after completing the Magistral he found himself in front of a door too difficult to open I wanted to stay in Italy to continue my studies by passing from the most historical philosophical scope but this has complicated everything he tells in Italy is extremely difficult to change the department even if he demonstrates that I have skills in the Filippo matters, however, he was motivated to go on I decided to apply for the doctorate remember even if many had advised against it I was convinced that I could play it on equal terms They present 250 candidates for six seats after the Selezio Neither for titles we remained in 25 but even before the oral talks it was rumored that everything was already established tells after discovering that he did not win the scholarship Filippo understood that the time had come to pack his bags after seeing the ranking are passed to plan B or to go abroad, but I knew that even that would be a great challenge after the selection by titles we remained in 25 but even before the oral talks it was rumored that it was already everything established is the beginning of a very intense period that Summer I sent eighty applications to various universities mainly between Canada United States Australia and England tells and in the end the choice fell on the first country I shared this change of life with my partner for which we arrived together with this decision admits Canada it seemed to us able to offer the best prospects to both not without sacrifices during the day work ravo as an intern in a multinational specialized in the human resources sector and when I detached at 6 pm I ran to the library to prepare the projects to be presented to foreign universities and to perfect my English recalls his efforts in the end were repaid. University of Montreal that from that of York and Toronto but in the end I opted for the latter also tells why Filippo found himself in front of an unexpected request, the University of Toronto has officially contacted me to be able to see the economic offers of the other universities so To be able to make a counter -offer explains and two days later I received an official communication in which they told me that for my research other ten thousand dollars had been allocated an incentive based exclusively on the merit I had not had any direct contact with them except through documents that I had sent and an interview via Skype underlined they made their choice only on the basis of my skills and projects which in Italy would not be possible from us the faculties do not have the opportunity to establish the extent of the scholarship and this makes them weaker from a point of view Contractual in the eyes of foreign students return is complicated when you live abroad you realize that our country has a career cost not indifferent one year after the transfer the expectations have not been disappointed we got the visa in three days through online procedure And my partner found work in a company within a week underlines Canada could not welcome us better at the moment so the chapter Italy is filed back would also be complicated because when you live abroad you realize that our country has a cost of not indifferent career and at the moment I want to enjoy these other four years of research here then for the future will be seen
 Often they ask me why I am always at the start if I never feel good anywhere I answer that for me the stupid is those who do not start Rachele Pilia are 26 years old and the last two passed them by working as an animator and waitress in a hotel of great Canaria tourist destination among the most popular of the Spanish archipelago for a few months, however, she moved to Barcelona where she started studying languages ??because she dreams of becoming an interpreter but she hasn't decided yet where she will live I don't think I will stop here forever my house was at Canaries now in Barcelona then those who know Milanese with Sardinian DNA of one thing is certain that the return to Italy is not among the options it is difficult to make nomadic life but in Italy I am not going to return to me the determination to escape me Abroad comes after years of false hopes for seasonal employees and underpaid around Italy and for the world Rachele began working immediately after Clas maturity Sica because he believed that making himself independent was the most responsible choice he thought that by making the tourist animator he could have kept economically and cultivating love for languages ??his efforts, however, were never enough I was tired of occasional and poorly paid proposals in order to work with Italian agencies I have Made even the animator in Egypt paid me 400 euros per month that all of them were in charge to call my family to leave for her it was a necessity and if she did it it is because in Gran Canaria she found better rhythms and conditions of living than that In Italy before leaving I also worked 54 hours a week and often with minimal compensation on the island instead I found greater professionalism immediately a good salary excellent colleagues and the most human times you work a lot but it has protected 100 and there is a lot More respect for the rest of the person in this free time Rachele has often heard home nostalgia With the exception of his brother who emigrated his family and friends to Milan in Barcelona and every time he goes to find them he starts again with a little melancholy my affections are changing their lives they marry family and I sadly be not to be With them a sadness that has tried to compensate teaming with other young compatriots expat guys between 20 and 30 years that largely left for its own reasons and with a great desire to support each other, you help you because you know That it is not easy to leave everything to live abroad in fact has an abnormable advantage for her out of Italy you can see life in a more lucid way because you face everyday problems alone and you stop worrying about the usual superficial details also for this reason has decided to give a second turning point to his career and start the university in the many years in which I have been a waitress and the animator I have experienced The fatigue and now I know that I do not scare me but for the future I would like a less exhausting and more intellectual job a job that involves what the language most loves before leaving for his journey Rachele already spoke French and German in Gran Canaria has I could have perfected them all in fact says Italian is the one that I speak less
 If you really believe it is never too late to revolutionize your life Sarim Cobisi 30 year old from Padua has chosen to do it during the university I was in the second year of economics of my unwritten city because at the time I worked as a salesman in a telephony shop with the Much coveted permanent contract tells IlFattoquotidiano it but at 23 years of age the turning point I win the Erasmus scholarship a first step towards change I leave the fixed place and led for my academic year to reading city south of England recalls an experience that He marked me deeply for many reasons to look out at an international context allows you to take part in a poturri of languages ??experiences and prospects explains and certainly my English claudant English made everything even more stimulating once the Erasmus is concluded and the certification obtained IELTS SARIM graduates from the Triennale and for the masterful he decides to Lanc To a new adventure abroad, however, this time the distances are stretched now I felt inserted in an international context and my choice has fallen on from the other part of the world to Australian National University, underlines almost to want to exorcise the limited reality of the previous years two years Intense and training I remember the fear of not being able to pass the exams and also the desire to demonstrate to myself that I could do it remember the fear of not being able to pass the exams and also the desire to show myself that I could After graduating in Australia, his journey continues on an unexpected way I chose to move to India for an internship like Digital Analyst reminds you to push me there was always the thirst to live different experiences here will be able to confront a totally new reality I fell in love with India for his traditions and for his human values ??so strong recalls but the s Typendium of 500 euros per month although it was sufficient to lead a more than dignified life to Ahmedabad did not allow me to put aside anything for this after a year decides to get closer to Europe by choosing London as a destination thanks to my knowledge of languages ??and my experiences Precedents I had access to many offers so admits four years ago my London life began that led me to be a digital manager for a multinational financial sector that of Sarim is a seven -year long journey but it is not said that one day not stop again in the place where everything started I do not exclude that I can return also admits nostalgia for our lifestyle and our climate on the future of our country then has a positive vision the recovery is slower than other European countries but I think strongly to the cyclicality of the economic recessions which I continue to invest heavily in Ital ia then explains in these years of life abroad I have realized how Italians in general are particularly tenacious and workahrosists, Italy I am nostalgia for our lifestyle and climate even its professional future is all to write I love my current I work but the passion for the real estate is really great so who knows he says to today when you look back can only smile I realize that in seven years my life has totally changed it underlines and all this happened because I believed that any long journey starts With a first step often the most difficult one that bangs out of the comfort zone behind these results, however, there are also many sacrifices I have always immersed myself totally in the life of the country in which I lived and this obviously implied a strong sense of distance from mine affections concludes today, however, I know that it was worth it
Even dreaming of open eyes can become a job and yet few would have bet one euro on that Milanese girl who left only six years before from the suburbs to make what until 2012 seemed little more than a chimera to work as an art director for a great international agency such as He dreamed of since he was a boy when he loved to collect advertising campaigns from the school desks obsessively cut out of each magazine instead of the usual sandwiches to succeed but after so much apprenticeship and a bittersweet experience in Manchester where to keep his studies he arrives to work even as a Nepturrbino Martino Monti today 35 Years decided as many protagonists of the stories to tell in this column to give up everything to accept a proposal from the jun von Matt of Hamburg eight months of internship at 500 euros that in Germany beyond the commonplaces are enough to survive before the sliding door that in October of that year this vol ta in an almost defined way the doors of the international market today Martino lives in Dsseldorf where he works with a permanent contract at the BBdo one of the most prestigious advertising agencies in the world the main office is in New York his first real success comes with the Snickers spot the chocolate tablets produced by Mars a short and ironic storytelling with which he pays homage to the world of martial arts then last June in the face of all the detractors and those who during the years of the apprentices had branded him as bankrupt takes home Two statuettes at the Cannes advertising festival thanks to the Remember Me social campaign dedicated to Alzheimer's patients but to do so we said he is forced to leave Milan where he grew up with the myth of Armando Testa for many years he finds herself live with short contracts at 500 euros per month The first agency gave me 250 every three and made me feel lucky even when I gave up my first Stage because working ten hours a day for a few euros is hard they told me that my style was old and in this world I would never have combined the prize I also dedicate it to them in Germany after five years I already had three promotions and a salary which is triple compared to those who do my own work in Italy, it is said that the cost of living is higher nothing more false the work of the creative of those who start from a white sheet dream of and create the spot that we will then see at Television or on the walls of the international metropolises is of the usarable ones it will seem strange but sometimes I would just like to use my hands and be a waiter ours is a very conceptual job and after three months a campaign on the best thinking about the Sessa what ten hours a day you need There is no shortage of gratifications for a Latin like me with a holiday for a holiday with my character it is not easy to live in a country like Germany m To here even if it seems the usual speech from emigrant c is a meritocracy that we dream of us are rewarded the merits the commitment and not only the relationships by living outside I cut professionally all the bridges with Italy and if I wanted to return it could be a problem without contacts without friendships you don't go anywhere in Milan it is ugly to say it because abroad I am proud to be Italian and among us we help us a lot we team up the problem is the Italian in Italy who lives the competition with the only goal of making shoes At the neighbor the future I would like to travel a little around the world I have already been to Singapore in the future who knows maybe New York knows we creative we get bored easily we need to change the air of having new stimuli in Italy I would like to return one day maybe after winning a lion D Oro and a Grand Prix in Cannes I am convinced that it would be a nice pass
 Sometimes it takes ten years to get to the year that changes your life Jacopo Daeli has already warned his tattoo artist in San Francisco where he will go to make the twelfth tattoo will affect 2017 the year in which he entered the heart of Silicon Valley in California for Working like Lead Software Engineer in Godaddy the register of domain names for the largest websites in the world a brain that paws and a country that more than point of arrival is a launch ramp The story of Jacopo Daeli is not exactly the usual Jacopo is A village of 3000 souls south of Varese started from Daverio and at 29 he arrived in a leading company with over 17 million customers but he did not escape from Italy he did not turn his back with anger only he dealt with his dreams You want to make the lawyer in Italy you have thousands of opportunities and earn well you want to make the computer engineer go abroad if you need to move to reach your dreams then it should be done it is with nsaiocity from that of being finally the only one who should have and could worry about himself to that necessary to have to look beyond the border to make a career especially in the case of Web Development and Software Engineering L Italia is an excellent gym and the university is not only used to have A title but guarantees you a unique life experience and teaches you to reason to solve problems quickly in particular if you do engineering or more generally a scientific degree but the Bel Paese is not yet among the best markets, the opportunities are limited and the funding for the Emerging companies are scarce compared to the rest of Europe and in particular to the United States there is still not a real tech and start -up culture The best IT engineers go to the USA for this to work there had become my dream there is no disappointment in the Words of Jacopo but the realism of moreover the distance between reality and dreams is called action and So Jacopo designed every step in detail the Triennale and then the specialist degree in Milan enrolled in the course of mathematics and computer science of the state road and two years later became a citizen of the world in 2009 he left for the Erasmus in Paris where he has A double life of IT is started working on open source projects and from photographer in documentaries and services I followed the lessons remotely from France and I returned to Italy to take the exams with an eye to the Eiffel Tower and one to the Cathedral continued his studies at a distance with The two -year period in Telecommunications Engineering at the Polytechnic of Milan but soon the job began to knock more and more insistently from the peephole, however Jacopo did not see Italy but abroad in fact I have never worked in my country also because in Italy the IT engineers are paid less than other countries such as France the United Kingdom and the United States from France has thus flown to London as Chief Software Engineer and then again in Paris as Head of Engineering for a French start -up in this European ping pong, the creation and creation of Flip has also arrived, an application of transfer of documents that by exploiting a direct connection called Peer to peer It allows an sending without weight limits and faster than other existing applications thanks to Flip Jacopo has been able to travel and present its work in the field of systems distributed to international conferences, the application is obviously in its very personal Greatest Hits on par with the satisfaction of having managed to visit several countries including Japan Hong Kong Singapore l India Thailand and the USA at the top of the ranking, however there is the being in the beating heart of technology and innovation in one of the strongest companies on the world market in Godaddy Jacopo deals with problems of scalability and reuse of the software And in particular it focuses in bringing the company's infrastructure to the public cloud essentially Godaddy instead of having proper servers rents them from external providers such as Amazon Web Services AWS works a bit like electricity we do not buy a current generator but we rent one From the Enel that offers a supply service Jacopo therefore follows the movement or migration of their infrastructure from their data processing centers to external cloud computing services here in the USA C is an approach to different work The search for perfection is at very high levels There is a crazy efficiency that is not found everywhere and there is no fear of dreaming there are very bright people determined and career drivers motivated to make a career then certainly living in San Francisco is cool you go to the beach you walk in the vineyards of Sonoma and yes It surfs to Santa Cruz but the true paradise is the working world where courage determination e Professionalism really pay which in Italy does not always happen not yet at least the word of Jacopo Daeli the Italy for me is one of the most beautiful countries in the world there are problems but if we try together you can solve work in the USA means working with people more talented in the world but if I could have the same job and the same opportunities that I have here in America also in Italy I would return tomorrow
 No I do not like the victimism that distinguishes us is evident that from us to achieve the objectives often we need more energy than elsewhere but engage for your country gives more taste and makes the efforts decipprated the victims is the antechamber of the Inedia in his career Alfio Quarteroni He has visited over 100 universities is a world -renowned mathematician has applied his studies and models in various fields from earthquakes to space has made the America's Cup win with his calculations at the Aldhi hull twice a country without sea Switzerland e Now he has decided to return to Italy to the Polytechnic of Milan for his new challenge to unite big data and medicine to explain the heart with mathematical equations in Italy you can do excellent research there are many excellent universities and our researchers are among the best in the world Notice we start from the end because the director of a prestigious Institute of the Poly Polytechnique Fdrale of Lausanna Expert should be returning to Italy by spending a Grant Erc of almost 2 5 million euros in 2002 I founded the MOX a laboratory at the Polytechnic of Milan explains Quarteroni I knew I found the context of the skills and the right enthusiasm to carry out Iheart, then this is a project potentially great social impact it seemed to me nice to develop it in my country the desire to return, in short, it was a lot of 65 years in the Swiss federal universities, it stops tells Quarteroni despite having received interesting proposals from prestigious foreign universities from the United States to China I had no doubts at the end was one Almost natural choice at the age of 33 full professor at the Catholic of Brescia at 38 years old in the USA The passion for mathematics comes from afar and yet it was the commissioners of the high school exam that convinced him to enroll in the university when I already had a place in Banca smiles the professor The first time he left Italy i Nvece Quarteroni was 27 years old and a pass for Sorbonne I shared the study with researchers from five different countries after a month a colleague from Tokyo University asked me with great delicacy if I was really Italian because I was working too much remembering too much two years later the call came from NASA and Italy from us there is still too much room for the recommendation to respond quarteroni to be children of or pay relatives still too much seems to me, however, at least in the university field in recent years has made a long way thanks also to the increasingly based evaluation systems on objective parameters is increasingly rare that to win competitions are inadequate candidates, it adds indeed given the great pressure of excellent emigrants and eager researchers to return happens that in our competitions there are extremely worthy candidates in supernumerary compared to the actual availability of open positions the problemIn short, it is structural, for example, a National Research Agency is still missing such as the American NSF that would allow to create an authoritative and strategic address system of which our political system could benefit explains the mathematician and still salaries too low oppressive bureaucracy reads not Always easily interpretable lack of clarity all factors that also discourage foreign talents to choose our country and yet there are many positive sides often ignored starting from an educational system that in spite of our self -critical attitude continues to churn out kids with an excellent preparation for quarteroni there They are dozens of fantastic universities in Italy that allow you to go out with extraordinary preparations and absolutely superior to those of the vast majority of European foreign universities but also US then for the doctorate it is almost natural to consider anch The choice of leaving is essential that many young people take the street of the foreign will thus learn to work and live in a multicultural environment and this is an invaluable value for our society because those who return will bring knowledge and networking the future for Professor Quarteroni It's called Milan we have the mox and then the Spinoff Moxoff adds we have a mathematical engineering course that all of Europe envies us the Iheart project will last 5 years and will allow you to finance almost 50 between doctoral and post doc from the whole continent when I was abroad i Italian researchers were the best remember they distinguished themselves for the ability to look at infinity, our more have an extra gear and often that healthy and naive idealism that turns them on to passion when they find an interesting problem in a competitive environment and concludes one healthy desire to show everyone that we are no longer the country of pizza and sweet to do nothing before finishing the interview the professor is keen to add one thing I was born in a peasant family without culture my father stopped after the second grade my mother after the third but this did not prevent me from studying and graduate in a prestigious university for this reason I am infinitely grateful to my country Credits Alfio Quarteroni Mox Polimi and Cmcs

 The difference is all here that the United States is based on the merits, Italy instead stands on the clientele Michele Diom is 35 years old comes from Naples and is a director at 18 years of age, he moved to Rome shortly after in Paris then I understood that if I wanted Really to build my career I had to go away tells today is working in Manhattan in the company of Oscar winner James Ivory yes to the beginning it seemed like a dream but it's all true Michele in Italy collaborated with Dario Fo and Francesco Rosi managing although among many difficulties in making the My projects in 2015 directed his first Sweet Democracy feature film starting to present him around the world this is how I arrived in the Big Apple tells the landing on an international set was in short a natural consequence one of the main differences is right in the concept of meritocracy Here in Manhattan if you have an innovative idea you are considered a resource not like in Rome Do you And it immediately becomes a danger to censor as you could be a threat to the clientele system on which the entire work architecture is held in our country tells Michele the days pass quickly between the set and the work with collaborators from many parts of the world But also with many Italians who stand out here for their skills and their merits tells Michele New York he taught me precisely the great value of the relationships between people on a professional level Giorgio Arcelli Fontana director and actor of Piacenza transferred for years to Manhattan is For example, the protagonist of Dance Again with me Heywood the film that Michele is shooting in New York in collaboration with James Ivory by observing America from Italy in short, a young director with a claudicant English will seem to involve a master of the film in his own film cinema like James Ivory Oscar winner recently for the scene Ggiaura of Call Me by Your Name and author of masterpieces as what remains of the day actually American cinema being a real industry does not ask you who you are and where you come from or even worse who sends you explain Michele asks you only what you want to make and How much you are willing to get involved so that your idea becomes a concrete project has tried Michele to describe the Italian situation to his American colleagues, meritocracy in the US is taken for granted has nothing revolutionary is a natural and inevitable fact only in Italy There is the pathology of clientele that determined the total stall in all the sectors of our country insists including cinema where the decisions that count are made by officials appointed by continuous politics I tried to explain to my New York colleagues that in Italy the leaders of the cinema decide politicians as if Donald Trump could choose who will produce the next film of Steven Spielberg obviously I only aroused their hilarity I often read the column of the Fatto Quotidiano Cervelli on the run and in every story I always find something that I have experienced firsthand in my work of producer and Filmmaker explains Michele I consider it more than a column one Sort of war bulletin in which they fell to the front and survivors the latter are those who have had to leave Italy in order to carry out their professional activity to me concludes did not go differently and yet Michele maintains a deep emotional and cultural bond with Italy The state of affairs explains to me I explain that politics has the moral obligation to take responsibility for having assassinated my generation advice to a young Italian cinema student I would say to leave the country as soon as possible in the United States in particular the student is al center of the school in Italy is subordinate to the rules n And it becomes a mere applicator and all this destroys creativity and still here in New York I met professionals who operate at the highest levels and who have not yet completed 30 years in this sense, Italy must be urgently still over in all sectors continues Michele return if the Things do not change in the sense of a total reset professionally speaking there are no conditions to do my job in Italy and build an international profile cinema Mine is not a choice concludes but a constraint
For a brain so accustomed to calculating every smallest probability up to the last decimal it must have seemed a real gamble to leave and give up Genoa without a rag of scholarship and with the risk of finding himself being a waiter at night to pay for his studies but a Pizzico di Fortuna never hurts even if as Bruno Benedetti researcher at the University of Miami the mathematics in the blood and today after years of sacrifices and transfers you find yourself developing data with the funding of the National Science Foundation Roba that in 2006 when he left with The first flight to Berlin would not even imagine I knew well to me I also told me my professors who if I wanted to continue studying the only alternative would have been to leave Italy so he ended up in Germany at the court of a certain Guenter Ziegler who for a student of mathematics is a bit like finding himself in the case of a young footballer to dribble directly With Lionel Messi of my Genoese training I have an excellent memory both on a human and professional level after a specialist degree in Algebra I absolutely wanted to study the combinated but there the doctorates are not always paid so it tells without a scholarship was how to make a jump In the dark, the only life jacket were the 600 euros that my parents passed every month and at the beginning I believe me I was forced to choose between a regular meal and a coat for the cold but fortunately after just a few months of instability the ministry approved the project of the Berlin Mathematical School by bringing together the three universities of the city under the same roof was a real blow of luck, the school to be born needed international PhD students willing to study mathematics in Berlin and I needless to say I was the ideal candidate today after ten years around for The world from Stockholm to Boston Bruno has finally found its size on the coasts D Ella Florida here in Miami makes a level research in the field of discreet geometry or in the study of the pyramid or dodecaedri cubes who with the advent of digital explains to you are back to have a strategic importance for some sectors in practice unlike what you do With smooth geometry we deal with all those objects that are not round using Algebra geometry tools and probability our research consists in the reformulation of new theorems or algorithms linked above all to the world of IT of Italy in addition to affections seems to have nostalgia only of good cuisine Even if here in Miami the Italian restaurants are not lacking and I do not complain I do not hide my culture and my origins tells fun but because of my Genoese accent that has the same cantilena as the Portuguese they all exchange me for the Brazilian, however, no saudades for the mathematician Ligurian happy to have left a The Italian mentality is decidedly antimeritocratic system that of the do ut des is absolutely carcinogenic if I choose you as a speaker for a conference I do it because I think you are the best not because I pretend something in return when I organize events in Italy I feel like a fish out of water In the United States, each university offers each professor a personalized salary based on merit just as in football the more universities want to buy you and the more your salary salt who knows what would happen if by law all the Serie A players were paid in the same way we bet that in A flash of all the champions would ask to be sold abroad an almost trivial principle in football as in the academic field that pushes everyone to commit more to obtain tangible results in short, good reasons to return to Italy only during the festivals proud to have won that bet ten years ago and to remind him in addition to the L Ibro of Professor Ziegler always on the bedside table C is also an old black coat the symbol of luck and courage for making that jump in the dark but if he hadn't done that jump Bruno often thinks about it I don't think in Italy I would have made a career I am not brought I would probably have remained bottled in the laccaculism in the usual dynamics and at some point I would have left my academic career to go to teach mathematics in some high school I would live in Genoa with my parents and I would earn a fifth of what I earn today but knowing maybe I would be equally happy
 I remember the day I left I remember well I was 24 years old was August I hugged my brother and I was sad we both knew that I would not be back in Naples it was not a goodbye was a farewell to Italy Vincenzo Cerullo was born in 1974 in Melito in the province of Naples near Scampia smiles after graduating in chemistry and pharmaceutical technologies in Naples a specialist in Houston and the foundation of spin off multimilionaria who beat all the records of fund raising Valo Therapeutic today lives and works as a full professor in Finland in Helsinki when I signed The contract remembers I made a promise I will repay you you believed in me and I will no longer go away his first experience abroad was a PhD in Houston in Texas I was 20 years old and I didn't speak English every evening I was crying on the phone with my girlfriend of Then and my friends tells and yet the motivation was huge I wanted to become a scientist I learned more  in my years in Houston that in my whole life in 2009 the decision to move to Helsinki my wife is Finnish we were looking for a place where you can match work and family no there is no country to the best world of Finland for the quality of life an example In the last 100 years here it has been invested to lower the difference between the rich and the poor explains Vincenzo the delinquency does not exist is not fought has no reason to be there even the continuous fines are based on income and this is something that after 11 years ago me Still to explode the brain, on the other hand, we are thinking of the flat tax that has nothing civic sense after a long and careful series of interviews Professor Cerullo was preferred to an internal candidate for the position of full professor, the path with that band began so of Scalmanati who is my group of researchers smiles are 20 of which 12 Italians see you every morning at 9 for A coffee in the laboratory and we compare ourselves on what our dream experiments are saying I think that confrontation helps the students to think out of the ordinary to stimulate creativity yes because today we have the technical possibility of doing everything for this we must pigs the right problems continues Also because medical research in my case costs almost 10 thousand euros a day and it is my task to make it productive and sustainable explains Cerullo and then in Finland the laboratory keeps it economically the professor here in Helsinki continues the doctorate is given on the basis of the number of publications at least Three in the first name is one of the very few cases in the world, the students so they are spurred to do research to publish to produce and not to temporee differences with Italy just take one every day Victor 8 years old first child of Vincenzo returns home alone after school Yes by law all children must leave school at 12 30 When the lessons are finished, my son was one of the last to receive the keys of the house only because he had a dad Italian confesses Vincenzo the children are in short responsible for small Victor cuisine eats and he spends the afternoon with friends while my wife and I We are at work Nicole 4 years second daughter goes to kindergarten for all and with a teacher every four children on June 21 Vincenzo Cerullo was appointed full professor by anticipating the pre -established times of over 4 years a few years ago after receiving one of the Grants more prestigious and competitive research in Europe ERC Consolidarer different Italian and foreign universities called him asking him to return in some cases by offering double the triple of what he earned in Helsinki and yet I feel like something to Finland confessed from 3 July 2018 however it has become Associate professor also in Naples Tarno SP In my city I love my Neapolitan students smiles Vincenzo has never heard a brain on the run I only followed my opportunities says it is like football players who wandered from one team to another to follow their career I don't see why if it is it It makes a researcher is a scandal is something that we should be proud of even the Finns make it adds the problem if anything is that we are unable to be attractive to Naples rather than the sun and the climate is missing mozzarella today there are 15 Degrees and it rains in the heights of summer but I almost miss me I realize it so much my job that everything else does not count the future I had a dream I conclude Vincenzo to work in a laboratory where I was the worst and here there are students who at 20 years old In short, they left friends and comfort every day I learn my dream in short.
When they told him the first time he almost struggled to believe it is not true I'm dreaming remembers from Pontedera 24 years and a degree in Economics and Management Maria Vittoria had just entered the staff of the mayor Bill De Blasio in New York with a permanent hiring contract Maria Vittoria Gronchi was born in a small village in the province of Pisa after the Triennale at Bocconi an exchange program with Northewestern University in Chicago experiences at the Who in Geneva and Shanghai today lives and works in New York where he deals with the public administration I was the first Immigrant to make the farewell speech in the history of the Rockefeller College of Public Affairs Policy smiles while he talks about the college where everything has started since the three -year Maria Vittoria has followed periods of study abroad over time has slowly used to leaving Italy even if mine Mom would not be agreeing tells when in June 2017 he decided to move it permanently to NYC without returning as expected then he understood that something was changing permanently every time I leave my mom and my brothers at the airport I am always moved I am very missing from America Maria Vittoria appreciates the way of thinking and solving the problems of interest Always innovative audience here arrived the master in Public Administration I studied to become an American health expert focusing on two Medical Public Insurance programs and medicating simultaneously I immediately tried to find a job to stay in America in January 2017 thus arrives the first I work at the New York State Assembly I was in the staff of a parliamentarian at the head of the Mental Health Commission of the New York State I was responsible for following the laws introduced more than 100 per session on their path to the vote in Parliament from there Maria Vittoria has Attempted Application for ORD L OFF Icio Budget and Management of the Mayor of New York six months later received the job offer I accepted on two feet despite having already had a return ticket to Italy from there to a week as was for a 23 year old working next to the mayor de Blasio almost every week the mayor organizes a meeting from 19 to 22 in the neighborhoods of the city explains Maria Vittoria in which he sees the citizens and answers the questions of those present I had to monitor these meetings to understand which ideas were financed and which I did not feel really incredible things Maria Vittoria is keen to emphasize one thing I have never had problems with discrimination despite the fact that I was not an American adds in the public sector it is difficult to see to the work of foreigners and yet in my department I was the only one today Maria Vittoria had to leave the Mayors for visa problems Office and moved to the NYC Health Hospital Corporation currently the P The large public health system of all the United States here are senior financial analyst and supervised some of their particular programs of alarm clock type at 7 breakfast overlooking the apartment in Brooklyn frenetic work in the office from 9 to 18 often I remain more but not a lot here you have to Knowing how to demonstrate everything in your working hours tells in New York there are no standard days there are infinity of things to do everyone runs towards something but it is really true that in the United States there is more meritocracy yes here no one cares nothing How long are you for example if they believe that you are welfon and you can bring value to the public or private organization that they are my old director explains to you was 35 years old and full decision -making powers on millions and millions of dollars to invest in the city in Italy instead yes it goes on by age rather than by capacity here the permanent place does not exist perhaps backwards I think it is more useful for my country to return with a wealth of experiences Maria Vittoria imagines a mother in his career probably in Brooklyn my boyfriend is an engineer from Bologna who arrived in the USA 6 years ago here builds luxury skyscrapers if he returns should reinvent himself from scratch We would like to go home certainly but not frustrate the professional sacrifices made during all these years and then I conclude I am interested in the public administration in Italy we talk about public competitions random allocation perhaps you have to wait for the person above you to retire or change work for Having your chance and I don't think there are many 24 -year -old girls in the public sector who monitor programs for more than $ 30 million each

Seeing your father to leave his lack for a year and wait for his return without knowing that on that day you will be said to you a truth that will change your life forever we move to France and here your life of 16 years starts to shatter to do The suitcases quickly because the time they will give you will never be enough to tell my grandparents to the friends and places of your Naples by car the mother and dad in front of you and the two little sisters of 15 and 5 years old on the rear seats My father was an aeronautical expert in a company in Pomigliano d Arco but after a few months of strike and the beginning of the layoffs our economic situation began to quickly degrade many expenses and little future in front of the eyes it was necessary to make a decision quickly also because we were five in five In the family in seeing again in the past Vittorio Valentino 37 years old teacher tries a certain tenderness I was a tear boy or from his Neapolitan suburbs from his newspaper from his high school during adolescence an important period for his growth to be included in a completely different country like France in a completely new context without speaking the language or know no one after a few difficult years In fact, in Pomigliano his father asked and obtained a transfer to France to Toulouse where his company collaborated with a French company from an economic point of view was an important turning point since working away implies a better salary even if we were very young we children were aware of our precarious economic situation and we accepted this choice even if we knew would have distorted our lives seen by the comfortable living room of one's native land The life of an Italian abroad can seem stimulating and compelling undeniable the enrichment linked to the experience of the migration tells the 37 year oldNeapolitan but for all those who choose or who are forced to choose this path, the pain linked to the nostalgia today Vittorio is equally undeniable is a professor university researcher at the University of the handmade among the most important in Tunisia after a first migration to Tolosa when he had 16 Years followed a second transfer to Tunis only two and a half years ago where the 37 -year -old teaches Italian literature and migration literature in the transition from Italy to France, in fact, the passion for the figure of the migrant was born in him after years of adaptation in such a reality Different from my Neapolitan outskirts I have undertaken some letters of letters, perhaps for words with which to elaborate the loss of Neapolitan citizenship that feeling friends and affections transform and move away to become small stains so the transfer from Naples to Tolosa also wanted to go from a technical institute in a high school with Literary orientation then a degree in Italians in Toulouse a specialist in Montpellier with thesis on Erri De Luca to end with a doctorate always in Montpellier on the literature of the migration in the Mediterranean context a few years of precarious teaching in France were enough to receive an invitation to have one Chair in a Tunisian university in the Mediterranean basin migrating was often the response to great upheavals related to colonialism and the sufferings of the last southern Italy that came out destroyed by the Unit of Italy embarked before fascism a great poor and hopeful emigration to Africa and Tunisia l Italy fascist has been in Africa a colonial power that caused enormous damage and suffering according to migration experts The only way to face the current arrival of migrants is to look to the past and realize that you live in years when young people also Italians resumed the path of migration It is his own story that he had to have left my place of origin coincides with a very precise state of affairs that meets those upheavals and suffering that southern Italy has been undergone for more than a century and a half and that have made it a place of Departure a wound from which he flees continuously so he was for my father so consequently it is also for me despite not living since he was 16 years old Naples remains the city that I feel most I think he never really went away from Naples too If more than twenty years have passed, for me the symbol of belonging and my roots the dialect or music always accompany me as if I had never left it so much that during the university years in France Vittorio even made a request to do some Stage in the Campania capital was then that he had the certainty that he would never be able to start an academic life in Italy did not want to me O Father and have condemned us children to spend only the holidays in Italy in the city that I feel my surrounding from my dialect and close to my way of being I know that I will never be able to teach in Italy where they do not count meritocracy and curriculum but only degrees of closeness with People who count and who decide who has to count a relationship with their country who becomes paradoxical because the Tunisian salary that allow Vittorio to live well in Tunisia prevents him from visiting Italy in Naples are in the family but seeing other regions of Italy often becomes Difficult to be a tourist in Italy, it requires an important economic commitment, you find tourists in your country and moreover with difficulty and yet Vittorio cannot turn his back on his country and hopes to be able to return to live one day perhaps only as a migrant yes He understands to what extent his place of origin remains under skin forever credit

Sincerity and human warmth but also cheekiness can often make the difference in a work environment Thick Dominik Schlegel 26 years old born in Glarus at the gates of Zurich but in love with Rome where it designs software for mobility in Italy there is no lack of work culture or l Imagination to create it is missing companies and the context in which to practice it and this is a shame by working every day at the development systems of location and mapping for vehicles at the Sapienza University in international teams between one conference and the other manages to measure the distance that separates our country From many European cousins ??I see many Italian colleagues who finished the research period go to France Germany United States and this is deleterious for a country that has invested resources for the formation of these people after graduating in 2015 in the Engineering Computer Science at the Eidgenssische Technische Hochschule Zrich Eth The Federal Polytechnic of Zurich He chose to write his thesis right in Rome I did not do the Erasmus but I precisely ask for a thesis abroad specifying my preference for Italy I did not have a scholarship finished my studies and returned to the homeland works for about a year in a High Tech company that develops software for electronic payments I took the equivalent of six thousand euros net per month and between the 700 of rent and the 2000 to live they remained enough to think about the future in Switzerland I took six thousand euros per month but I preferred to come to Italy and ford Less then why return to Italy to be a researcher while knowing that the salary would have been much lower about 1500 euros gross without the benefits he had first like for example an excellent apartment apartment the truth is that I like how to work in wisdom also L Italian research environment is less hierarchized than the Swiss one where to break the interpersonal barriers an That between colleagues often becomes a problem here is much more sincerity and frankness if I do a wrong thing they tell me immediately without too many turns of words and it is essential in this type of work the team in which he works develops location and mapping for vehicles In Italy, research is competitive although it is very unwanted and submerged by the bureaucracy an example in Switzerland you have a fixed budget, you just need to show the receipts of what you purchased to work and you are refunded here instead you have to pass for the approval of the administration that is looking for Always the as possible equipment as possible this slows down the times of a research The nearby future of Dominik will not be Italy and it is not a matter of money but I will return to Zurich the search period I receive a lot of job offers but not here where they are missing companies that develop these technologies a bet that ours The country at least for the present has already lost a few kilometers beyond the alpine border C is precisely Zurich which has become a hub of international companies in the field High Tech is a pity that in Italy there is no opportunity because there are many engineers really capable that Dominik, however, is not necessarily a farewell I would gladly return to Rome I love this city concludes if you could attract or create more highly technological specialization companies many things would change and you Italians should not even be important brains from Europe because you have many of them only need to an opportunity
 If you go we are proud of you if you don't go we are proud of you the words of her brother and her best friend after Chris Mattmann manager of NASA technologist from the skype box said ok Giuseppe as here was 2015 and the life of Giuseppe Totaro was about to change forever the first time that I set foot to NASA I thought it was a dream not hiding that still exceeded the security checks at the entrance always I always turn to my right and I look at the great symbol of the space agency smiling everything has started Three years ago when the Messina was selected first for a six -month internship and later for a full time position at NASA in Pasadena in California but perhaps this story begins even earlier when a professor of the University pushed him not to lose sight of The search my family has always encouraged me to give the best in the study with a great spirit of sacrifice after a degree In computer science with 110 and honors at the University of Messina, in fact, for six years he worked as a programmer both in the public and private sector and yet Professor Dora Magaudda continued to follow me encouraging me to take a research path so in 2012 I started the doctorate In computer science at the Sapienza of Rome achieved in 2015 under the supervision of Professor Massimo Bernaschi had seen us along that tenacious teacher because during the last year of PhDs, the Internship at the American Space Agency arrived and shortly after a new proposal by NASA for one Full time position as Scientific Applications Software Engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory The laboratory that deals with building the unparalleled spacecraft and NASA spacecraft as curiosity, the robot used to explore Mars are surrounded by extraordinary scientists the section in which it is work is Rice Manager ICCA and develop software technologies for planetary exploration and earth science in a few words when the data of the missions return to Earth the task of elaborating them is given in the hands of the group to which the Sicilian belongs there is no other organization in the world with this story Where it is possible to contribute to space missions such as Cassini Curiosity and Rosetta today Giuseppe lives in a small apartment surrounded by green in Pasadena in California and works for the research and development of complex algorithms to analyze spatial missions data also collaborates in projects financed by the Department of the US defense as a memex program to create a new intelligence system capable of contrasting the trafficking of human being through the analysis of the Deep and Dark Web La Nasa has a charm of its own while it is at the Los Angeles airport waiting for a flight of I work for Washington D C The 36 -year -old tells how every cen Tro Federal of NASA is structured in a different way, its laboratory for example is perhaps the most academic inspired by a university campus with many open spaces and in the middle of the greenery where you can work with colleagues and drink a coffee a spirit of stimulating collaboration that It allows you to work with scientists who come from various sectors such as mathematical astrophysics and mechanical engineers I came here with great enthusiasm not to escape from my country and from Europe and to think that everything started from a commodore 64 I was in fifth grade and when I received in gift this home computer my father says that my first thought was to study the basic language manual to program the solutions of the mathematics exercises what allowed that child of Roccalumera a small Sicilian country wet by the Ionian to be one of the researchers today of the most coveted space agency in the world commitment and passion for the Scienz My father is a public official and my mother a postal employee did not push me towards computer science but together with my grandmother and my aunt they have always encouraged me to give the best in the study with a great spirit of sacrifice an incentive then derived from the sweet severity Of his mother who did not forgive him low votes at school, for this reason I am always enthusiastic for those who commit and get important results both in Italy and abroad because I don't think it is the place to make a special result but the commitment and passion for Getting him happy because he works with passion for new unique spatial challenges in the thoughtful world instead when he thinks about the price to pay I would like to spend more time with my family my girlfriend and my goddaughter Gaia I would like to breathe the air of the sea of ??my wonderful Sicily I came here With great enthusiasm not to escape from my country and from Europe I live this experience to the maximum every day but My thought always remains to serve my country in the future and while dreaming of a family hug and the air of sea Giuseppe is preparing to continue this dialogue that every day the NASA asks him to carry on with the space you want to know which one is the biggest teaching that they transmitted to me the stars that we are infinitely small but also large enough to be able to make a decisive contribution
Getting back into the game after losing their jobs looking for luck to abroad just as young people do what in Italy are called brains on the run and do it when the age is no longer that of the degree or of a first job but begins to approach that of retirement This is what Lino 63 -year -old Italian engineer did that after the liquidation of the company he worked in and after looking for a new employment in Italy always as an engineer moved to Stuttgart in Germany by investing in language and master courses professionalizing his own Experience, however, did not go to happy ending so much that subsequently he folded up on France where he said more to know how to do that the weight of age also for this reason the name we use to tell his story is fantasy to safeguard his family and not prejudice his search for a new occupation in Germany I sent many curriculums and they got there Many answers congratulated me but they also said that I was too qualified or that they could not offer me an adequate place explains Lino to IlFattoquotidiano it the truth is that Germany is not the El Dorado who tell the Italians here are often on the margins of the company who thinks to find luck but it does not have a qualification is exploited maybe earns 1500 euros gross per month but has to pay about 500 euros in taxes if it has no dependent and a room finds it can also cost 500 euros in black in short, live more than living for The young people are there any opportunities but this underlines Lino is because in Italy they did not have a job or they were precarious but for those who created something and want to go on it is not possible to accept these conditions the language is then a wall and it is not easy to speak a German adequate at the level of a specialist work in Germany who thinks they find luck but do not have a qualification are exploited linen is a All effects a brain on the run even if over 60 as evidenced by his curriculum which in addition to a degree in civil engineering and various master's degree master's degree boasts the knowledge of five languages ??and apical roles in various companies with works even in Africa up to the position of Technical director in a large company in Bergamo since 2005 with the crisis of the construction sector and motorway works, however, the company is in composition with creditors and then in liquidation and linen finds itself on foot no longer young first in layoffs and then on the move however It is not lost of mind has a family of children the need to work with the competition won in the nineties begins to be a teacher in high schools as well as small consultancy works at least in order not to stay still and interrupt mobility everything becomes enormously more difficult For those who are exceeded 50 or worse for those like me on the move have exceeded 60 and have to wait 68 To have a pension that will no longer be adequate but in the meantime what the mortgages are done, the family wonders Lino in my case they told me that cost too much but I also looked for lower level jobs the important thing was to work in Italy despite the curriculum L The only opportunity that presented himself to Lino was that of teaching a buffer solution which, however, cannot last for much the construction sector is completely stopped for people like me here there is no market, companies are looking for young people to exploit them or wait to win a Procurement to hire staff I also thought of returning to Africa but then some acquaintances and colleagues told me about Germany told me that there could have been possibilities for figures like me and that I could work in the green building sector what I noticed is that immigrants Even the most educated ones occupy positions well below their abilities and qualifications So Lino at the end of June 2017 moved to Stuttgart where he attends a German course for level B1 and B2 followed by a minimaster of the Academy Engineers to know the German construction system all this, however, it was not enough to fit into the labor market I thought I was benefited from the knowledge of other languages ??continues but also for positions of lesser responsibility it is necessary to speak and write in German in a perfect way it would take years for a young man and what I noticed is that immigrants even the most educated ones occupy positions well below the In short, their ability and qualifications Germany is not the paradise of work and this despite the boom in the construction sector which compared to Italy is very active and has development projects for the next decades in Germany there are many Italians but not only young people tell linen are the generations who came in the 60s and 70s and now in pension and or people who in Italy had a qualified work managers or former failed entrepreneurs who have lost everything are ashamed to stay in their country who does not help them to be seen unemployed or failed then they come here and accept any job even the most humble to do in order to do Something Lino, however, decided not to settle so in April he made his suitcases again and started for France in Germany I had the opportunity to make the postman in the wait to learn better the German but with what perspectives having a family behind him if I were State young I would have stayed but I cannot have felt the anger deceived, however, concerning his path c is and is so much towards the false myths of Germany but above all towards his country, Italy the work office in Italy is simply useless an economic wheelchair that It only serves to those who work in it if compared to the similar agencies of the employment of other European countries more c In Germany as in France the equivalent employment centers provide services that in Italy are unthinkable as a councilor who guides the search for work training and minijob of 450 euros per month that can then be integrated with the help of the state in Italy not There is even a website adequately structured, the finger is also aimed at the state of affairs in Italy in northern Europe there are development projects until 2030 in our country, everything is still the Italian construction companies, they combine 90 percent abroad e So the best entrepreneurs of Made in Italy fail or go beyond
 My university pays me in a year what in Italy I would not take in four the 39 -year -old Nico Cappelluti University of Bellaria is that of Miami from there today he guides his team of researchers after receiving an email in 2015 that changed his life to him He had been parked for almost five years in the office forced to live every year with the anxiety of the renewal of a research allowance with which to keep the family until a message from Professor Meg Urry arrives who wants him with him at the Yale Center of Astronomy in one Of the most prestigious universities in the world in New Haven, in addition to doing research I learned how the world of great American universities works, for example developing a rather unknown concept in Italy that of mentoring, that is, the sharing of experience to encourage professional growth and today life Di Nico has finally changed to Miami where he lives with his wife and a son collaborates with NASA and Labo Rators of his university guides an international task force ready writes L Ansa to reveal the secrets of the dark matter whose 95 of the mass of the universe in 2010 had decided to return home but the low salary and the diffuse precariousness push him to leave The arrival in the United States was the second abroad to abroad because in 2004 Nico had already made the suitcases to move thanks to a scholarship at the Max Planck in Monaco to study extraterrestrial physics a bittersweet impact between lights and shadows with the company And with German culture, so much so that in 2010 also exploiting the tax deductions of the Framework Law 238 had decided to return home a good law but as always in Italy a piece is put to cover a large flaw upstream a problem called salaries Too low and precariously widespread but not only will I say a perhaps unpopular thing but in Italy it is also the fault of those who think that a doctorate It is equivalent to a permanent place in public research in other countries to doctoranches is clearly explained the chances of remaining in the academic world are low but especially in America they have c is high tech industry that offers decidedly competitive salaries smiles by scrolling through the American site with a finger Physical Society that each have publishing the average of the admission salaries you understand why those who leave the academy is not quite so desperate I hope that even in Italy you start investing in institutions of excellence certainly looking outside the window of its new home is not everything Gold what glitters the 15th of the Americans lives in poverty here still have a classy education system that continues to have repercussions on a racial level and of gender level, health care also sucks for those like me who can afford it in short, the purist version of capitalism has Created a monster of social inequalities and the arrival of Trump does not have Aiu but then there is the other side of the medal of a country in which meritocracy remains a serious thing and the abilities of individuals are still ruthlessly rewarded in an objective way I hope that in Italy it also begins to invest in excellence institutes by financing research groups With the Peer Review you have to create a way to encourage private funding to the basic search to remove the Irpef from the salaries of the researchers it is useless to go around us there are too low salaries and a poor enhancement of skills so as not to mention the ignorance of ignorance that Today it is almost cool but here a sociologist would be needed I am only a astrophysician smiles what friends and family is lacking but also the culture and lightness with which we know how to face life in the States the puritanism of a part of society is difficult to tolerate For someone like me, I'll go back to maybe one day I would like to be born from us an IST Basic research by the public without the boulder of the public but would need philanthropists as the industrialist who has just donated $ 100 million to our university
 To make such a radical change of life, you must rely on the power of your motivation word of Ilaria Maiorano born in Montevarchi Arezzo 29 years ago after graduating in Sciences of Social Education at the University of Florence I understood that finding a place as a teacher of asylum or educator It would have been a difficult company already tells because every time he made an interview he felt repeated the same refrain I'm sorry you have no experience we cannot make you work like this Ilaria rolled up my sleeves first I found a place in a factory then I made the civil service that at least I allow myself to build a wealth of experience in my sector, however, his efforts have not been repaid I started the research again but without success so convinced of his dream he made a drastic choice after returning from a trip to Frankfurt and informed me about the German reality I decided to move there remember to hit her and The kindness of the people and the air of serenity that was breathed admits but before the great jump was prepared well I dedicated six months to the study of the German and then as soon as I arrived to work as a waitress to maintain myself I told I dedicated six months to the study Study of German and then as soon as I arrived I started working as a waitress to keep me despite the desire for change and his strong motivation The impact was hard the early days I tried a lot of solitude I was far from my family and in a place where I did not know Nobody remembers but I kept hard and in the end here I found a beautiful world working in an Italian restaurant he met what would become his future husband after some time we moved to his area of ??origin in the Palatina Rhine in the south of Germany had arrived The time to resume his goal I enrolled in the S Cuola di Tedesco and after six months I applied to obtain the recognition of the studies made in Italy and at that point he says they told me that I should have attended a course of 15 lessons with an exam and a final thesis in social pedagogy a decision that has them The doors of the future was wide open even if I still did not have the official recognition I applied in the various kindergartens and they immediately took me as a teacher based on my value and my knowledge remembers and after discusing the thesis they offered me a permanent contract without counting the other benefits here provide funding and free days to invest in your training without counting that salaries are at least double compared to Italian ones with the same cost of living admits even if I still did not have the official recognition I applied in the various Kindergartens and they immediately took me as a teacher that of Ilaria is a story with happy F Ine with a single note bitter I will always be grateful to Germany for giving me the opportunity to do what I studied for and it is here that I see my future underlines but obviously I feel nostalgia for my family of food and our culture when looking back But it can only be proud I have made the road and sacrifices to get to here but they were all repaid admits I am firmly convinced that young people have the right to live a decent life and to conquer their independence, however, it is not always possible do it in your country I ran a risk and today I know I made the right choice concludes but to go all the way you need courage and so much determination

 I left my land because forced by misery and humiliation Jonathan Cilia Faro is 36 years old and is a tenor in the United States, 14 years have passed since Italy lived perennially frustrated by any type of tax burden because what the world Of Italian music he taught to the 36 -year -old from Ragusa is that to make the artist in the Belpaese you have to get used to seeing kids of just 18 years old touring throughout Italy only because they came out of a successful talent show while the professionals must be satisfied with unsuitable wages Some television programs killed the work of professionals by ridiculating Italian art tells the young Sicilian remembering the years in which it was not enough to have two works to pay the living costs of transport and taxes on his artistic performances in Italy even if you work 80 hours a week you can't put together more than two thousand euros and between petrol food ensures tion of the car and home management in practice we work to survive a continuous stress a daily strangulation between bad payers and debts to pay the taxes of precarious works in the music sector that led him in 2004 to take the first flight for the United States without Reninkings I started angry and with 300 euros in the prepaid card hoping not to review that nation that had removed every dignity in Italy even if you work 80 hours a week you cannot put together more than two thousand euros now Jonathan is a popular lyrical tenor in time Full record producer and vice -president of an entertainment company that gives work to ten Italian professionals owner of two recording studios that has become Italian American in 2000 in the States the tenor and producer earns four times compared to the pay he received in Italy so as to tell himself from his home of New York a villa transformed into a big one Materially residential recording studio I cannot complain of I have reached everything I could dream of having yet there are things that well -being will never repay him as the suffering of having been forced to go away forever the lost friends not having been able to see my mine age Parents and assisting them as I wanted and the distance from my children do not be a prophet at home is a humiliation that is not accepted creates anger and dissender and yet America has given the Italian tenor a second possibility to feel certainly made the initial difficulties were not lacking in the First year in the USA I worked day and night saving and doing my apprenticeship as an emigrant in the true sense of the word then the meeting with people who believed in his Mediterranean talent and the desire to start again suddenly you wake up and remember the reason for which you have escaped from Italy the working system that does not work difficult PL Acare the soul of a dreamer so much that the tenor if he thinks of his old age is imagined far from the American dream to age on the hills of Lunigiana perhaps drinking of good wine while playing briscola you will not believe it but I miss the good morning of the baker who that I need hot bread, good air coffee at the bar with friends and the pleasure of reading a paper newspaper while I savor a cappuccino because Jonathan loves Italy cannot deny it loves people, food and wine, breathtaking landscapes Historical and artistic culture Then suddenly you wake up and you remember the reason why you escaped the working system that does not work and yet overseas while eating a plate of spaghetti in front of a red of the import of his beloved Sicily does not matter how far or committed to the first fork of spaghetti They cannot fail to ask me who knows what will be going on today in Italy
 Ever since I was a child I understood that to realize my dreams I would have had to go to Palermo Fabrizio Li Vigni is 30 years old a degree in philosophy of knowledge and communication and a suitcase full of ambitions that was not possible to create a The three -year time I went to Barcelona for a master's degree in contemporary philosophy tells but there was a culture that more than any other fascinated him the French one I watched films and read novels in the language so I chose Paris for my second master and then I applied for The doctorate in sociology of the all -ess cole des hautees tudes en sciences social attempt I have been successful I am in the fourth year and I can consider myself more than satisfied with the path that I have done so far for three years I have been teaching at the university both at the matrices and other PhD students I have Three books on reptiles and many other scientific publications is published and I realize that everything is Esto would never have been possible in Italy even if the beginnings were not easy it was not all roses and flowers remember during the first year and a half the night I worked as a goalkeeper in the hotel and in the afternoon I followed the lessons of the Master, however eight years later Having said goodbye to Sicily he hears that his efforts were repaid to live here opened my mind and put me in touch with another type of civilization continues all things that I cannot say that I learned during his studies in Italy Fabrizio fails To hide his disappointment for the situation in which our country is facing to look at it from outside and with the eye of the sociologist I realize how much our system is sick from an early age on the streets of Palermo I breathed a clientele and overpowering culture e This has pushed me and many other acquaintances to pack their bags as soon as possible and these are the reasons that still keep it away from our country In these eight years I have never thought of returning to return from time to time because I have love for art and as far as it is positive but I know that it will be difficult to attend a radical change in the coming years especially for those like me who are engaged in me Scientific research in Paris in fact he had the opportunity to confront many compatriots many professors of my university are Italians were gone because they found no satisfactory jobs and wanted to keep away from any patronage process here things work in a way My superior is completely different has no problems knocking on my door and asking me information if on a certain topic I know more about him based on his experience Fabrizio can only recommend a period of study or work abroad all countries should have one youth that goes out and then returns more enriched the problem is that Italy He is going to hemorrhage because many young people leave not to return anymore

We always tend to look for a crack between the East and the West but in reality the difference itself can be a source of balance when we learn to accept it is this the greatest lesson that Laura Imai Messina writer and university teacher has received from Japan lessons that seeks To transmit with his novels, the last published by Piemme is not oso say the joy of the history crossed by the themes of motherhood and friendship always poised between the east and west born in Rome in 1981 Laura moved to Tokyo thirteen years ago I studied letters to the Sapienza when by chance I came across a Japanese culture course and it was a love at first sight as it tells as a degree gift I asked to spend a year in Japan to make research and a first level doctorate has no longer returned to comparative cultures And a PhD finally the contract teaching in some universities of Tokyo to act as a glue to all his studies C is obviously Writing is a passion and a need that I always carry behind but I managed to concretize it only by living here underlines this country has imposed me a slowdown and gave me attention for every single expression in Italy we make friends easily while it takes times here Biblical to earn someone's trust but in addition to work there was an existence to reinvent on my arrival I felt extremely alone and struggling with a communication system light years away from ours remember we immediately go straight to the point and we make friends easily While here it takes biblical times to earn someone's trust learning the language, however, it has facilitated things today I express myself with much more calm and I relationship it in a different way depending on the interlocutor I have in front of it underlines a perspective far light years from what he was We used to us Italians always tend to make comparisons and make the SCs Painful helmet explains here I understood that there is no need to find a solution at all costs sometimes it is necessary to give yourself time is he then unraveling the skein in Japan Laura also met his husband who then became the father of their two children we are there meet at the end of my two -year master when I had already decided to stay underlines you have to be convinced when you make such an important choice of life otherwise when the relationship ends everything collapses its love for Italy, however, it has remained unchanged now I come as a tourist then Mine is a privileged vision premised and yet I realized we are too critical of our cities we Italians always tend to make comparisons and make the painful choices today that has learned to take the best from both countries also entertains to mix them in the his novels the first times I made a clear distinction between Tokyo and Rome between Japanese and Ital characters III admits but with the passage of time these differences have attenuated and they give me unpublished points of view his city of adoption then is a source of continuous inspiration despite the public and private dimension here are clearly separated the city is mostly made of Windows and every morning from the train I see a lot of life to scroll through my eyes from the guys who train in the gym to the women who make the fold tell all ideas that go to popular my stories always winking at joy I understand that in age Adult happiness is a choice and a responsibility is the constant maintenance of one's emotions concludes for this we must take our life in hand and bring it where we like it more
 When I say that I am an art historian, people think that he should recite my part on a guided tour, I assure you that it is not so Nicola Nitido is 24 years old for 5 he left his Naples and Italy and has recently returned from Antwerp where he has After the traineeship financed by a Spanish university I find myself in difficulty first of all because my career is not conceived tells the Spaniards are surprised to see an Italian transferred to study and work abroad in a sector then like my Nicola left Italy in 2013 Despite an arm wrestling with the mother contrary to her choice I left for a personal challenge to understand my limits and my possibilities remember in Spain Nicola obtained a master's degree in History of Art by studying a curricular internship and working part time To stay in Madrid I left the house early in the morning to return when it was now night but I don't leave me Iavo escape the possibility of going to the theater at the cinema or around the museums almost the opposite of Antwerp where all the activities led to the office hours and since the shops closed at 17 C was time to devote themselves to sport or specialist courses adds After a three -year degree from Dams, a master's degree in Art History in Madrid and one in Museology and Management of the Heritage Nicola arrived in Antwerp thanks to the Erasmus + program having developed the degree thesis on the Rubens Museum House but things did not go like The career of an art historian is not conceived is not conceived tells Nicola I would just like to raise the voice for a field our very niche unfortunately it is thought that the art of art is not a profession as if it were missed of dignity continuously is reduced to mera tourist guide but it is not so it is also the constant visit of our museums of our cultural heritage is also to find a thread a connection between the works of art go deep must be said in the country with the greatest UNESCO heritage in the world ours there is no professional continuity in the sector of art history unless explained Nicola you are not the son of some important personalities for This together with some researchers and professionals in the sector Nicola has constituted a group with the goal of redeeming the right to this abandoned and less fortunate profession compared to the others often the Neapolitan researcher was forced to explain to his Spanish colleagues and directors that yes that To move to Spain was his clear and precise choice dictated by the intention to continue his studies in his sector, unfortunately it is true to me more than once and even in different contexts the Spaniards were surprised to see an Italian in my field transferred to study and work abroad differences between the University system I Italian and the European one The Italian University still remains distinct from the other models here in Spain c is total absence of orality each examination, we pass by writing a essay and working in the group the problem is also in the university preparation beyond the few funds For universities and therefore for research the big problem is to create study courses with very few concrete possibilities once done for Nicola is also at stake in this way is the same motivation as a researcher working permanently in Italy for the moment I am a citizen of Europe if C It is a safe thing in the world for us is that we have very few certainties continues I do not want to complain about my country but you have to be aware of the reality that surrounds us if I had a magic wand would make sure that our heritage was known and recognized enhanced and protected by citizens who are the first users once returned from Antwerp Nicola Pas He knows the days at home by sending curriculum by updating newsletter passing hours in front of a screen I hope to happen in the right place at the right time before concluding my relationship with Italy is comparable to that of a child who requires and is waiting for some deserved attention but This mother is already busy thinking about many other children
The main difference that in America you buy it in Italy you have to deserve it Emanuele Viola left Italy in 2001 during her doctorate at the Sapienza of Rome I gave up a scholarship for a Phd ad Harvard then I moved I moved In Princeton at Columbia and Boston today he is a professor of theoretical computer science at the Northeastern University in Boston returning to return so I hope to return one day Emanuele born in 1977 was born in Rome at 14 years old programmed the video game Nathan Never followed by Black Viper at 24 years old the first Journey to the United States for a doctorate in computer science at the Harvard University followed by a Postdoc at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton and one at Columbia University then I became a professor at Northeastern University in Boston where I received the chair a few years ago I go to the University A few days a week to teach or participate in various meetings but spes I know I connect via Skype the typical day can vary according to academic work personally they work better if I spend a lot of time at home in almost complete isolation explains Emanuele if I don't have to teach I generally place in front of a white sheet trying to solve some continuous problems as long as It is the hour of my walk in the woods so at least in one thing I can feel close to Einstein and Darwin smile I go to the university a few days a week to teach or to participate in various meetings but often I connect via Skype l it Italy it is very lacking less and less Time to visit it and the difference with the US academic world is drastic American universities are directed as companies in competition constantly in search of more money better professors and better students here after you have been admitted is almost as if I already had the Degree in your pocket is not exactly like that in Italy of 200 of my course remember I was the only one to graduate in five years, that is, not going out of course for Emanuele then the academic world and Italian research has not only problems of funds indeed a hundred years ago it was typical for an American scholar to pass a period of Training in Europe continues Emanuele in a few generations, the situation has exactly overturned in this sense the problem of Italy is also that of the rest of Europe and other parts of the world, America has stored such a quantity of brilliant minds from all over the world that It is very difficult for another nation to be competitive regardless of the funding indeed those of the European Community are substantial and competitive at this time in America, the funds are not many specifically for the theory here there are more possibilities for students deserving in Italy in my field There is very little research the situation overturns for the doctorate Here it does not have a predetermined duration if they do not throw you out, you go out when you have competitive publications for which there can also be six or seven years in Italy, the pre -established duration is three years absolutely insufficient to produce competitive publications This difference is also due to the fact that In the USA, the student's salary comes from the Advisor in Italy mainly from a state bag if we speak of training in short, the speech personally changes I consider the education that I have received practically free for much more solid wisdom than the typical American preparation, however, it is completely overturned for studies Advanced here there are more possibilities for students deserving in Italy in my field C there is very little search the most beautiful memories the very rare moments in which the clear feeling of solving a mathematical problem came to me happened once while I was rolled on my ball and three times while I was walking for Cemeteries smiles the goal for Emanuele is to return to Italy even if with the family in America it has not been easy for some time I plan a sabbatical year in Italy I hope to combine contacts well and that maybe one day not too much they translate into a return the environment In a private university where taxes exceed $ 50,000 there is completely different from what I remember my student days and yet Emanuele wants to say something not I don't want to give the impression that the money will make a lot of difference is that America managed to attract the best minds from all over the world concludes and no other country has succeeded in it
 Italy is an old country governed by Vecchi per Vecchi in 2012 five days after graduating in medical biotechnology at Sapienza Alessandro Dasti was already in London with the hope of finding a doctorate after a year in England one in France and three in Spain the researcher Italian does not think about returning our political class in the least is so self -referential that he does not have the slightest idea of ??where the future is going after graduating from wisdom with full marks Alessandro Romano has sought luck in the United Kingdom without great results thanks to one European Scholarship managed to obtain an internship at the Curie Institute in Paris and before moving to Barcelona to the Centre Regulaci Genmica today deals with research on embryonic stem cells differences many my post -graduate internship in France was financed by a bag once expired, the terms offered me a regular employment contract combined by a Salary of level recalls Alessandro in Italy instead in my laboratory for example C were often very qualified researchers forced to work for long periods without remuneration or without a stable contract in Paris Alessandro had the opportunity to participate in several research works by signing the published articles Which does not always happen in Italy explains where the names are put by political convenience so that the main author of the article is climbed by people who don't even know what is written on the article himself smiles in my laboratory in Italy C were qualified researchers who worked Without being paid to the Regulaci Centre Genmica in Barcelona, ??the scientific and academic world is certainly less verticistic and more horizontal adds, it is inclined to be authority on what is produced and not for a mere factor linked to the age also continues the research sector is much more there Bero an example, the Roman researcher is dealing with experiments on a family of protein and their role during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells in Barcelona the day moves later than the typically Italian one begins around 9 am starting from the experiments with approaches of cellular and molecular biology after having lunch with the other colleagues in the laboratory we move on to data analyzes and maybe you study some new articles to stay updated on the search theme The main difference is that here I can dedicate time to myself to Rome time out of the laboratory I spent bottled in traffic or waiting for a public vehicle, Italy does not guarantee meritocracy removes native excellence and does not attract it thanks to research Alessandro has managed to live in different countries to meet people who come from all over the world and discover habits and cultures other than our i n more traveling has allowed me to learn languages ??that I would never have imagined to speak until a few years ago the Italian problem lies right here in the poor ability to attract people from outside we don't only talk about funds but about a system that is done continuously Alessandro does not guarantee meritocracy removes the indigenous excellence and does not attract the academic world to CRG is more international and much less formal also I have the impression that in Italy the heads of the student researchers are much less horizontal and there is much more reverence for what that The head says Alessandro at the moment does not think about it here we live well I would move only to go to other areas of Spain but not in Italy to date I don't think my country can guarantee a decent future for a young man and adds the CRG is a Emblem for your column concludes Alessandro The Center in fact hosts an important population of Italian brains in F UGA representing the largest foreign community these are researchers who occupy all positions from laboratory technicians to research directors who have published on the best scientific journals in the sector such as cell and natures here out of 519 researchers 59 are Italian almost 12 of these 4 Principal Investigators Alessandro wants to reiterate a concept I do not want to give the impression that abroad is all positive and I think it is right to be grateful to the country that has formed me but Italy is firm and without prospects we are a country with a great past that But he concludes he believes he can only live on this
When he was still a boy Marco began to plan the Commodore 64 that his father bought as a work tool for the third grade examination with the maximum votes using a multimedia presentation that he had created from scratch without the help of Power Point or any type of application since then has begun to work with computers focusing on graphic music and video animation after the opening of a company the crisis the drop in investments The transfer today Marco Genovesi lives and works in London together with his family behind him is 10 years of Experience in the field of digital visual effects 30 Hollywood films an Oscar A BAFTA and the VES VISL Effects Society Award In various categories l Italy I remember two things La Diffenza because I was young and the work in prohibitive conditions in a basement tells in 1992 at 14 years old Marco He works day and night with a schoolmate of his to deliver a video game Co based on the new comic book to be released at Christmas in 96 the second video game comes out and shortly thereafter constitutes a post -production company with a very young friend we rented a tiny room that soon we filled with all the little technology that we could afford to the time and therefore we opened the our company the computers we used had chosen them component by member and then assembled alone to save some money despite having very limited economic resources we worked day and night until it earns credibility and a good number of customers remember Marco we had little money but we worked day and Night to earn credibility and customers after the 2008 crisis and the drop in investments Marco understood that it was necessary to move out of Italy to have new growth opportunities in 2007 I realized that the Italian market was becoming more and more competitive and not in terms of Quality The Race Upon Discounted Price and Logici who rewarded the friendships instead of the merit made me realize that that was no longer fertile ground and to improve my professional skills I would have had to transfer elsewhere is at that moment that a proposal comes from London from a society that was finishing an entertainment film Within a few days, Marco makes his suitcases and part at the time I knew yes and no about fifty English words smiles thanks to the commitment and tolerance of my garment project, things went as hoped for that film Marco was hired by another company competitor and shortly thereafter he was promoted to the role of head group in the film The Chronicles of Narnia in 2010 became head of Department of digital environments for the London office differences in the lifestyle primarily the journey to the workplace in Rome despite the chaos and the trafficking of epic proportions I could still enjoy the beauties of the city those that the whole world envies us ESA Latate from the blue sky here in London explains I must settle to move closed on the subway and those short open -air sections are often accompanied by a gray hood that rarely leaves room for particularly exciting views Smiles London is an extremely varied and multicultural city but here there He feels linked united in diversity despite the class of nationality genre or color of the different skin continues Marco I realized that the world cannot be judged according to simplistic categories here in short change the way of seeing things but an entrepreneur can have more luck in Italy or At the foreign difficult knowing it says I limit myself to saying that the taxation are fundamental but also the bureaucracy and politics The panorama of the world of work is extremely fluid our generation must agree to move have passed more than 10 years since Marco has left The Italy the company where he works today co NTA 3 500 employees in offices scattered between England Vancouver Montreal Bangalore and Los Angeles his latest contribution is on the computer -commercial version of the Leo king who will be released in 2019 and yet the market is moving to India where the cost of labor is a fraction of how much it does not I am in Europe to return to a very strong link with my country and with my hometown explains Marco here in addition to my work I am a musician husband and dad of a one year old child of something but the panorama of the world of work is sure is Extremely fluid our generation must accept to move and therefore I do not exclude that one day I can move elsewhere concludes or even return to Italy in the event that the conditions allowed it
Italy does not like European researchers the country of Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei no longer attract those who deal with the development of scientific research better to go to Great Britain Germany France or even in Switzerland and Spain rather than to come to the land of the Sun and the Pizza The data comes from the ERC European Research Council which in recent days has assigned 653 million euros for the benefit of 269 senior researchers throughout Europe giving them the opportunity to achieve their most creative ideas and potentially produce results that will have an important impact on science Company and economy among these sixteen Italian five that are abroad and eleven who will develop their projects in Italy have been awarded the important financing, a number that ranks us in fifth place compared to the previous year where we were third after Great Britain Germany France And Spain the problem is that while in other nations they arrive r ICARCORI DA TUTT EUROPA LA ITALY is snubbed by everyone not only in some cases Great Britain France Israel and Sweden those who stay abroad won the bag thought to return to their homeland while our five who abandoned the country do not come back if we then look at The situation of our house emerges another negative figure, the Italian projects will all be developed in the laboratories of Northern Italy Zero in the South South Unique Consolation is that the CNR The National Research Council can boast one of his man Andrea Cavagna among the 16 Advanced ERCs his project entitled RG Bio Renormalization Group Approach to the Collective Behaviour of Strongly Related Biological Systems is placed in the context of the disciplinary sector Fundamental Constituents of Matter and has the aim of studying understanding and classifying different phenomena of biological collective behavior by exploiting the analogy with modern developed theories In the context of statistical physics And of the critical phenomena in particular those who try to explain the lack of ability to attract researchers by Italy is the president of the CNR Massimo Inguscio we must focus the efforts and create places of excellence from abroad come if they find realities full of scientific connections who gets one or Two million euros must then manage and deal with the Italian bureaucracy need room for maneuver to be more free who comes from the rest of Europe need to find a place where the operation is sustainable for the future we must invest to create situations of Excellence words that go hand in hand with the lack of funding for research The European average is 0 47 of the gross domestic product but we stop with Spain at 0 33 percentage well lower than Sweden which invests 0 87 of GDP or the Germany with 0 54 The money in the research explains Inguscio is investments and not spent above all if they concern the Recruitment of people the CNR doubles its budget compared to the money that comes from the government thanks to European funds but the projects to conquer these denarios do the researchers
It is not difficult to hear Italian while walking through the Boulevard of Paris are often tourists with smartphones in half -air ready to capture moments and monuments but often young Italians are looking for better job opportunities these Italiens are different from the second post -war Rits of the Second The workers who emigrated in search of luck the new emigrants are prepared specialized formats with each other there is also Francesco Loconte 34 years old from Apulian and architect has been in France for seven years and emigrated the Oltralpe as his grandparents emigrated to the 1950s and then returned to Italy Just a year before my birth, the thought that I can follow in the footsteps of my grandfather after he makes me feel in peace with myself was a rital who earned his life by sweating in the factory and is also thanks to that sweat that Today I can afford to live by doing what I love Francesco is one of the many Italian architects in France according to data collected by the Cnoa Conseil National de l Ortre des ArchiteCtes, the Italian one is the most numerous foreign community on the 28th of foreign architects in Paris is Italian and the trend does not seem to stop what Italy is missing according to Francesco freedom of expression and creativity in a country like Italy The cases in which creatives manage to build their autonomy under the thirty years of years are rare at the Faculty of Building Engineering Architecture at the Polytechnic of Milan with a parenthesis in Madrid in 2009 for the year of Erasmus in 2010 I did the Master in 2010 In bioecological architecture and sustainable techniques for the Environment to Sapienza thanks to a European scholarship finished Master and University Francesco begins to work with VAT number that in his case means being a freelancer masked by an employee I soon understood that in Italy where Mobbing e laziness are widespread transversely if you want to do the architect you must be A good employee that the competitions of ideas are won by the friend of the mayor and that being a surveyor would have been the only way to economic independence I saw this fatalism transform into alibis into the heads of many of my peers but I think expressing their talent is duty Moral of the creative The differences between France and Italy for Francesco are many in France, the architect has exclusivity in architectural design while in Italy we have reached the point where the architect is a luxury for a few and the surveyor has the same skills in the field of design Architectural I do not want to denigrate the work of surveyors but I would reflect on the fact that years of study of the design methodologies in some way can bring added value when we build our cities finished the period from freelance in Italy Francesco therefore decides to move to Paris at the beginning is not easy above all because of the Language but an opportunity is presented four months after my transfer I found a place in a study by a former head of Jean Nouvel project an experience that allowed me to learn French and interface with the world of work in France where an architect to First experience does not earn less than 1600 euros, that is, more than double than Italy, the work begins to take off and in your free time Francesco participates in competitions together with colleagues with excellent results in 2012 I won a call for the extension of a villa in Belgium and signed My first contract in the same year together with an architect colleague and an Italian artist friend I founded the collective Kid to which is for a child architect there we can cultivate independence and moments of creative anarchy we work on different project levels from interior design to architecture on The wider scale the return to Italy is not excluded but at the moment all the streets at the horizon They remain open because I cannot even discard the hypothesis of moving to another country that is neither Italy nor France
With an engineering degree for 11 years, I have lived in the middle of the poor of Saint Paul of Brazil Marco Vitale Cremonese is 45 years old and his life before dedicating himself to the last was this mathematics 1 mathematics 2 physics 1 physics 2 chemistry examination exam vote after each The compliments were the good vote then the study for the next exam and on Monday morning with the sleepy body and on Friday evening, the Happy Hour at the same time Marco began to know the world with his beauties and dramas, the injustices in the hunger for inequality Corruption I remember the times of Tangentopoli with the desire for cleaning and the reaction of the people with the finger aimed at that politician or that party tells I did it too for every problem I had simply found culprits and then capable and borsell the indignation for the massacres It was so much the anger was strong but Marco had first to finish his studies and then find a job he gets it in Tori No in the branch of telecommunications here comes the turning point begins to attend the Saverians of Cremona I saw in them a fantastic moving life I wanted to live so at the best through them I met a group of boys who in Turin cleaned up from the rubble an abandoned war arsenal to transform it In an arsenal of peace, a house for those who have no peace for those who run away from wars Marco becomes thus becoming a missionary of Ernesto Olivero's sermig I was moved to see young people and families who gave themselves the changes to keep the door of that former factory open 24 hours per day I saw in them a fantastic moving life I wanted to live so at most Marco realizes that his personal balance was not so different from that of that politician who so criticized myself looked at the mirror and made the decision to live the I dream that I took inside so it started to prepare the shipments of humanitarian aid that start from the Arsen Ale in the evening in the silence of the factory at the moment of prayer on Wednesday night was my turn the next morning I took a shower and I went to the office the feeling was to live something important so he leaves the company and he throws himself soul and heart in the arsenal of Turin Today his life is dedicated to another arsenal in San Paolo by the other part of the Atlantic I live not only for what interests me and that I want but for what is needed here we do the good done well the arsenal in which he lives from 11 years in a city of 20 million inhabitants and full of contradictions between peaks of enormous wealth and poverty abysses has become a house that welcomes 1 200 people every day we have renovated a large building that in the past was used as a hospedar DOS iMigrantes one thousand two hundred seats Read with as many cleaning and warm meals of quality then there are the professional courses bakers pastry chefs Muratore tiles la sco Ola to learn to read and write a library the medical center La Sala di Arte The people who knock on that door have only what they wear and are victims of alcohol W drug Hundreds of people in desperate search for a dose more and more often young people's effort contributes to awakening a spark of hope in the hearts of those people we make it important we make good done well everyone helps each other we propose to the poorest to help those who have Need because you are happy to be happy you have to make others happy and you can do it everywhere according to Marco in Italy or in Brazil, nothing changes when they proposed to move to Brazil I left without knowing a word of Portuguese and yet Ernesto continued to repeat me not to worry about the language only worried about becoming good because the vouchers are not strangers ri in no land
Pamela was born in Rome but in Italy she never felt at home to the end perhaps because every single day of her life had to find it properly justifying because while speaking with a strong Roman inflexion her surname both Aikpa Gnaba and her skin It leaves no doubt about its African origins it is a profoundly frustrating feeling that of living in your country and having the perception that others always consider you a foreign element and that to feel accepted you must on the one hand deny your origins from the other always demonstrate to Being at the height of your Italianness, despite being the place where the 37 -year -old Roman daughter of a mixed Italian Ivorian couple has been born and raised has always seen Italy as a country closed in the face of diversity and therefore also compared to her the situation then in recent years The desire to go and live in a place where the s Uo multicultural and multilingual baggage not only was it appreciated but considered as a true added value when in 2014 I chose to move to the coast of ivory, the ground of my father's origin many considered it a crazy choice that would have made all the sacrifices made by me and my family to build something in Italy and instead in African land Pamela found something that in Italy had never been able to conquer or the perception of being accepted for what they are no one has ever questioned my belonging to this country And I have never found myself having to justify my hiker or to demonstrate at all costs my sense of belonging to be considered worthy of being in this place in a certain sense made me feel at home even when as soon as I arrived I was disorganized and I was leaving me a whole life elsewhere in recent years in Italy the situation with respect to the acceptance of the diversity has drastically worsened today Pamela Viva in Abidjan the economic capital of the Ivory Coast and works for a government body differently from what one might think does not earn a stratospheric salary but I can live well and also to put some money on the other hand in Italy Pamela had never managed to have great satisfaction despite her master's degree in translations and numerous abroad experiences I have never had great difficulties in finding work but often the contractual and salary conditions were not adequate for the tasks carried out and my professional profile also I have almost always had the perception that if I had projected forward in time I would have found myself after ten years at the same starting point without gratifications and with many expectations disappointed the feeling was to feel a hamster in the wheel that runs impressed but always remains As usual placed in Africa instead I have n Otato immediately a great dynamism The society is very young and there is a great desire to succeed and to improve a spirit of trust in the future that has given her new motivation and energy I realized that here I would finally have come to come somewhere Reaching personal goals without even needing to run since everything travels here on more human and less frenetic rhythms because for a young man to have work it is important but it is even more to have the perception that his skills are really appreciated while he speaks Pamela He defines the coast of ivory as his country of origin phrases that seem a bit of a defeat for Italy that saw him born and yet he has not been able to make it feel at home many of the Italian boys with foreign origins end up going away from Italy because not they have the perception of being accepted and appreciated as they deserve non -recognition on a legal social level and politician is often perceived as a refusal towards them and I think it is normal that they decide to go in search of places or realities that offer them more opportunities a feeling of frustration sails his speech because the young Roman knows that he could be a resource for Italy who has foreign origins like me could be an excellent means to access the new emerging markets of the respective countries of origin to carry out mediation roles with the communities of migrants who arrive in Italy to create virtual bridges for entrepreneurial and social projects because excellence is lost Not necessarily losing the individual elements but failing to have a vision of together that the 37 -year -old Roman one is not considered an excellence but it is certain that Italy could have better exploited what I and others like me had to offer Italy could have been able to make better use what I and others like me had to offer the eu Ropa is not paradise and Africa is not the hell between these two imaginary extremes there is an earthly world that deserves to be told with honesty and realism and while thousands of people every year risk life in order to arrive in Europe from Africa my experience goes In the diametrically opposite direction giving a message of strong trust in the future of the African continent does not feel an Italian emigrated Pamela but a woman who has found a second home I don't think I will return to Italy because I doubt that I can find the stability and the gratifications I have there At this moment in the coast of ivory and I have the scent that from here in the next few years the afro descendants will be more and more in Europe to take the way back
In the common imagination, the Italian researcher always has the suitcase in hand ready to start to go and get a better future and yet there is no shortage of those who decide to grant a chance to our country is the case of Giorgio Giulio Fumagalli born in Brianza 33 years ago that after The degree in medicine and the specialization in neurology at the Maggiore Policlinico hospital in Milan won a scholarship to work at the Dementia Research Center of the University College London an experience of a year that enriched me from all points of view I had way of knowing splendid people who taught me a lot from a human and scientific point of view tells IlFattoquotidiano it a fundamental step for those who like him has always cultivated the dream of research I have always been attracted to this area because it allows me to make a more contribution large and to apply my knowledge to do good to the greatest number of person It is possible to underline once the scholarship is finished, but Giorgio decided to give an opportunity to Italy obviously I had the doubt of staying in London or going elsewhere and it was not easy to come to Capo then admits when the Airalz onlus network offered me The possibility of returning to work at the Polyclinic in Milan I decided to accept with a more than positive spirit, things can also work in Italy and I firmly believe in the idea of ??being able to help my community from here explains what matters is to look for profitable collaborations and Transferring the knowledge acquired abroad obviously I had the doubt of staying in London or going elsewhere and it was not easy to come to the head thanks to the Airalz onlus Italian Association that promotes and supports the medical scientific research on Alzheimer in partnership with Coop Giorgio has the opportunity to go on with his studies often tend to confuse senile dementia with l al Zheimer but this dichotomy is wrong, the Alzheimer is the most widespread of the forms of dementia but others exist and each of them is accompanied by specific disorders obviously also the approach and the care changes depending on the situation the search that I am developing allows me to improve The diagnosis through the measurement of brain furrows tells and in cases like these the timing is fundamental because the disease attacks the nervous system in a silent way already many years before the first visible symptoms are manifested by a study that is leading to more precise tangible results is A more targeted diagnosis will be the therapy that the patient will receive underline aspect that is not considered the increasingly high rate of diffusion of dementias, however, it is good to underline that these pathologies have always existed even if they were called differently explains but in this historical phase ne nor We record a peak linked to age increase Media today dividing herself between the work of a researcher and that of hospital doctor Giorgio sees his future in Italy I would like to grow up here my children admits and then seeing them go away to return full of new experiences just like it was for me a door but it is always it is right to keep it open if they get attractive proposals I would think about traveling to travel makes us better people and professionals
To then start again expanding its horizons to change perspective to leave again is the philosophy of life that moves Stefano Pujatti architect Friulian class 68 and which today leads him to live between Italy and Canada always looking for new ideas and new stimuli after graduating all University of Architecture of Venice I flew to Los Angeles for a Master tells IlFattoquotidiano it I was fascinated by what was going on in the West Coast and I was looking for a different way of seeing the future an experience that has very influenced his career I found Of the fundamental masters I was inspired and following their example I then managed to build my path explains the Master finished in 1994 seen the air of crisis that was breathed in the United States in those years Stefano decided to return to Europe before Paris Then the return to Italy where in 1995 he founded the elastic study I wanted to see if here Ello on which I had worked could also have a response in our country remembers choice that I never regretted I would have liked to stay in the USA but I can't complain because here too I had the opportunity to do things of my interest I wanted to see if that On which I had worked, he could also have a response in our country experiences that allowed him to take part three times at the Venice Biennale and to win some international awards at practical work then from 2004 to 2013 he joined the teaching in the Faculty of Architecture at the Polytechnic of Turin working as a contract teacher I realized that the Italian academic reality tends to cut off the professionals undergoes what in my opinion wrong because a discipline such as architecture requires both the theoretical and the practice so after fifteen years of life in Italy has decided to question and a propos ta from the University of Toronto changed the cards on the table I decided to accept the assignment and I went to teach for two years tells this it allowed me to find new collaborations which prompted me to open another seat of my study there In Canada in fact Stefano has found fertile ground for his ideas are a very coherent and concrete people but they have an incredible curiosity for culture and artistic news underlines and this has allowed me to do many things among these the possibility of focusing on change Climate is a theme that I have always had to my heart and there I have had the opportunity to carry on my research explains to Toronto soon we will make the Maison Glac a house that protects itself from the cold thanks to a crust created by the ice today Stefano is divided between the Italy and Canada the distances do not weigh them on the contrary the dream is to go more and more west I would like to come back And in California I believe that my ideal nest is there even if I am not intended to abandon all of Italy, he underlines by working abroad I learned to appreciate even more our excellence and our cultural level that in his opinion should be better valued by the Our universities are excellent but often they invest too much in the theoretical part, however, there would be a need for greater elasticity explains above all in a sector like that of architecture ours is a job of experience and energy admits today many recent graduates have difficulty finding work because during studies They do not have the opportunity to test themselves with more concrete projects nor find examples to follow on a professional level of other part also the architecture studies also have objective difficulties today's economic conditions do not allow us to form training and this obviously goes to the detriment of the youngest subl Inea I receive many curriculums and I always try to respond to everyone personally by pushing them not to give up because ours is a beautiful profession in which, however, it is necessary to run risks I think that if a young man cannot find work in Italy the best thing is to go to Searching for other parts concludes I am convinced that it does not make sense to stay in a place just because you were born there the important thing is to find the best place to be able to practice your profession
Every morning peeking at that gray smoke sky perhaps thinks about it but where I ended up then it starts up and down like a splinter from the metro could very well get confused with one of the many English businessmans who every day crowd the City always won and impeccable shooting in their dark dress and the Financial Times under the arm if it were not for the strange one and a little Latin routine to have breakfast with Matteo's magpyhus of immigrant Rimini 34 years today we would say that he made it to you even if despite the British accent and a degree at the London School of Economics Him He continues to feel deeply Italian but do not take me as an example continues to repeat to those who ask him obsessively but how you have done I have only had a great ass may certainly not be found to find himself at 25 years catapulted into one of the most famous and large law firms to the world especially for a new one who nine years ago had arrived in Broadwalk House on tiptoe Almost by chance and above all without a grove of experience I had made the pr disco but I don't worth a smile I know how to sell well it is true but at the beginning I was also lucky then it specifies the degree I really took it in management and reads almost with the best Of the votes it might seem only the usual fairy tale of social redemption Il Rimini pencilized in search of luck that in the end does it but here the story also assumes the pink contours of the novel of love because Matteo must above all bless the meeting with a fascinating Inglesina grown to Scrippelle and

 No no here is not like in Italy where the help of the parents is fundamental we can hold my husband on our legs and I are in fact professionals and in Hamburg we are evaluated and paid as such the quality of life is very high and also allows us to put us On the part of the money to do what is most heartily traveling all over the world together with our two children Giordana is a Neapolitan transplanted to Germany before landing here worked as an architect almost ten years in Spain in Barcelona and six months in Dubai Where he had been called by a Japanese company responsible for the Dubai Metro Project to participate in the design of the two metropolitan lines of the city I went to do some cash he says laughing even earlier for eight months he had gone around the world to interview well -known architects like Kuma Mad and the most different meetings binding from which an architectour book was born in 2010 P was born or the definitive decision for the coldest country went from 40 degrees to Dubai to the least 15 from here he tells where, however, his boyfriend and future husband Stephan was waiting for in the charming bay of Halong in Vietnam Massages and lymphatic drains the state passes and also the Psychotherapy The life of Jordan is that of a mother with children in a country where families are helped maternity is protected but above all the conciliation between work and family is not an unattainable utopia but a simple thing and even obvious here I found the quadrature of the Cerchio explains I have a vertical part time with a permanent contract and I work on Monday and Tuesday 8 hours and Wednesday 4 for a total of 20 hours in Hamburg The kindergartens are completely free for the first 25 hours so I pay nothing and I can enjoy the my younger child in the rest of the week which will also be the last one since I am almost 44 years old and five airline tickets for our crazy routes I would begin to be heavy here I found the quadrature of the circle I have a vertical part time with a permanent contract but it is not the whole German state gives each child regardless of the parents' income and up to 18 years or 25 if you go to the university 180 euros per month the so -called Kinder Geld available to parents there are also numerous free structures for families where various swimming sports activities include but not only my great has passed a period of restlessness have recommended a path of psychomotor in one Beautiful gym not far from home totally free and under the supervision of competent volunteers has been very useful here in Germany for healthcare you have to pay an insurance that varies according to the income I pay 400 euros explains Giordana but half of this figure the pay the employer of I work if you think so much think that in this amount it is really included from the DEN Tyst to some drugs of post -birth gymnastics courses and much more my husband has made a cycle of massage with mud for the back and I a series of lymphatic drainage during pregnancy all covered by the insurance and then there is also psychological assistance when my husband He had a health problem 18 months ago after we had a psychological support aimed at the strategies used to avoid useless stress within the family, it was very much really workers who are never abandoned and protected children but it is above all on the theme of work and protection of workers that The civilization of this cold country is measured there is an unemployment subsidy that lasts a time proportionate to the years in which you have been employed explains Giordana but nobody takes it for a long time why finding work is possible when you take the unemployment check here the state you Check in a positive sense they keep your current account under examination In short, to do refresher courses they assist you are not abandoned if the period with the right to receive the unemployment check for expires and you still don't have a job does not remain without anything as in Italy here you receive help both for the house and for bills And for foods especially if you have children fortunately has never been missing the job but we know several people who use these subsidies when you take the unemployment check here the state controls you in a positive sense and about children Germany is one of the countries With the highest protection of the childhood in the world we start with pregnancy when you are pregnant in the clinics invite you to demonstrative encounters with a buffet where you clarify themes such as the percentage of cesarean cuts or the percentage of episiotomies and related motivations the parts are managed entirely by midwives and hospitals are very efficient for breakfast Matti na bring you a cart of food where you can even choose the type of bread but the real extent that makes the difference in a child's life comes later because the state sends is an obstetrician to help the mother in the post one day one day no In the first weeks then to climb for the first five months, it is also a social worker who ascertains that the child is treated well is desired is in a situation suitable not only the social worker also carries out an explanatory service by informing mothers about the activities of the consultors Where to make free pediatric visits to follow a baby massage course to receive assistance on breastfeeding taking a coffee with other mothers if the climate is ugly for distant places there is just no negative aspect that helps us to recover after the story of so much civil wonder is trivial I know it replies but the weather is terrible the problem is not the cold but the lack of light For me that I grew up in Naples is almost unbearable and then let's talk clearly the Germans are a little cold and not very flexible if you have to organize something even a coffee you have to send him an email a week before and sometimes it does not even work for both problems but Giordana found one Solution I move a lot in the Italian community of entertaining and close -knit organs I organize cooking workshops for children to encourage the use of the Italian language in groups I manage the meetings of a group of adults for the exchange of books and films in Italian often organizes events as per al Climate well every time the children have holidays we start, however, remember that in Germany it is forbidden to take a child and bring it abroad during the school period you can run into no small legal problems or even to be blocked at the airport by the police has already happened Keep in mind that they have 14 weeks of vacation released in everything The year for example in 2018 in Hamburg in the summer the lessons end up on July 5 and on August 15 we return to the desks so to resist the amburg gray we often travel our children were 5 continents from Japan to Australia from Florida to Seychelles thanks as I was telling a social life that allows you to live in peace and manage your money for disengaged and not survival activities the stories of our travels you can find them in my blog open ten years ago the Germans are a little cold I move a lot in the Italian community of entertaining lively and close -knit the last question is on the public discussion on immigrants it is true that in Germany there is a debate on the hypothesis of reducing welfare for European and non -European immigrants, it is not true as you want to think about The right starts which, however, is everywhere here concludes Giordana C is a strong will of integration that also starts from the lingu to see that the state pays immigrants to us a language course up to level B1 in general, however, all are aware that immigrants are a resource that the expats are very important for the country starting from the demographic increase up to its economy
 I had to go from Italy because I wanted to avoid almbineing a job and hope to find it thanks to a recommendation and so at 45 years of age a degree in philosophy in your pocket and a curriculum dotted with works of all kinds in charge of disassembling the stages of the great cashier concerts in A Libraio Libraio worker unionist Christian Ferrarese in June 2015 leaves Mantua for Bristol where he still lives and where he is a goalkeeper at night in a luxury hotel activity that allows you to live in dignity and develop other ideas during the rest of the day a second escape from Italy after the first twenty years ago always in the United Kingdom but in London in the first period he does everything he works from the fast food to the coffee of the Tate Modern Gallery then after a year he returns to Italy he tries again teaches us he works in a furniture factory as an employee and in a cooperative of porterage but then it no longer does it the usual problems the meritocracy that There is no difficulty in going forward without knowledge and recommendations and returns that feeling of suffocation that makes him fly again this time Bristol where among other things he also found the lucidity necessary to write a book released in January 2018 which he says he says Already all of my name is Cristiano Ferrarese I am 44 years old and I feel like a lucky person editions The galleon L -England tells is not the country of Bengodi The British are classists and thinly racists a little with all white Scottish Blacks American and Irish Italian and Spanish American and Spanish because they think To be the center of the world even if it is not so but it counts for them as the merit as works and not so much of those who are son or by whom you are recommended beyond any rhetoric after three years I can say that I have tried on my skin and seen With my eyes that the merit is rewarded here and the British make such a simple thing but that we do not do it in Italy or a LMENO is done too little they put people who meet the required requirements for 45 years from scratch and without parachute as if to emphasize for Christian has not been easy at all but today it has not easy but today has a job and some perspective guaranteed by What defines the English system here can start from scratch even at my age in the curriculum do not ask you for the photo the age and if you are your profile it is in line with the job you can do anything you can plan to dream and do business even almost almost 50 years of course that the rules are there and you have to respect them but one possibility is given to you as to him because at 44 years of age in addition to night work he also managed to put on a small business at the beginning of 2015 I met here in Bristol Nicola Macolino theater director painter and designer who has been working here in a pub for a year and a half we have started an online store that sells irreverent T -shirts Egnate and think by Nicola where I wrote the texts the heart the beat and the blood are the archetypes from which we started to create everything that can be bought we try to sell an idea since of T -shirts and the rest is strap the web beyond The Christian texts follow the whole part of the relationships with supplier and customers bank and accountant precise here it is extremely easy to open a partnership like ours or a simple company you pay nothing and the first taxes will arrive if they arrive at the beginning of 2019 here you have the obligation to Open the VAT number only after passing 80 thousand pounds in one year and only at that moment the highest rate is triggered we are trying how it goes
To hear him speak you would think that he is at least twice his age instead Antonio Calc Labruzzo Palermo by birth of years has only 35 but of ground kilometers he already has several of them immediately after the high school I left for Milan to study economics at Bocconi tells IlFattoquotidiano it and thinking that as a boy I was one of those who thought that he would never leave Sicily before ending his studies he got looking for a job I was specializing in human resources that at that time in Italy it was a sector at Alleo remembers but he has not struggled to find a position as an internship that after graduation turned into a more stable job the very young age and the desire to experience, however, they pushed him several times to change all the travels have been well thought out and made in the sign of my professional growth but then in a small part I have always listened to my intuition and so far He brought luck I always listened to my intuition and so far he has brought me luck so after moving several times to Italy Rome Parma and still Milan has decided to expand his horizons I was back from a beautiful experience in Emilia Romagna where for the first time I had Touched the bases of the company I had had the opportunity to work closely with the production and the workers but I had the dot to have an experience abroad so I started looking around the goal was clear I wanted to go to a growing country and assist Up to that moment I had had a perception to an economic boom in first person only from my parents' stories the choice fell on Shanghai was an exciting experience from every point of view I saw many young people of my age leaving a job sure to follow their vocation, remember the economic conditions allowed everyone to get involved And for him too it was a great challenge I lived a gigantic cultural growth that I would not have remained in Europe or going to the United States explains every time I found myself talking to my peer I realized that I came from different planets I miss them Irony the panache and the unpredictability all qualities that in Switzerland is difficult to find at a certain point the time has come to pack my companion and my partner who then became my wife we ??wanted to put on the family and Shanghai did not seem to us the right place for Doing to explain the right call came from Geneva for three years Antonio lives there and is responsible for human resources for a large Chinese company that operates in the food and agriculture sector I have already come to Switzerland and I had the opportunity to touch the monotonous hand The highest quality of life especially now that we have a ten -month -old girl explains Italy albeit so close geographically not n has never been so far away I am in love with our country and of Milan city that gave me a lot but living abroad I understood that ours is not the ideal place to have a family admits even if for a boy who comes from the south it is Impossible to forget all that beauty, Sicily has a huge potential could envy the whole world explains but every time I come back, it seems more and more aged a little nostalgia, but I am felt I miss the irony and the panache and the unpredictability all qualities that in Switzerland is Difficult to find not enough to return, however, never say never concludes but at the moment the reason tells me that it is better to grow children in an international environment and richer in opportunities
If I worked for one of the largest world organizations for human rights with international projects and considerable salaries you would be able to give up everything to follow your passions in many would consider madness to leave a position like his to become a freelancer of the theater but for Angelo Miramonti this It was the crossroads that had been waiting for time I felt that my job was very far from people from their problems and I wanted to see more concretely the results of my work born in Magenta Angelo worked for seven years for the UN training center in Turin then in the 2014 The departure for Senegal where he remained three and a half years, dealing with a great international association for the protection of children from abuse and exploitation of childhood marriage marriages female genital mutilation and emotional and sexual violence by working for them I had the opportunity to save money that money that now they allow me not to have pre occupations for the future would be absurd to do a job in which I no longer believe for reasons related to salary so much so that the 42 -year -old from Trecate for a few months has left Africa and the organization to move to Colombia and experiment with a participatory theater method with former fighters who They left weapons and with people who have suffered the violence of the armed groups for decades I want to devote myself exclusively to an activity that I think has made sense for me and for the people with whom I work in Colombia I do not have a single employer I work for different NGOs e University while telling 3 30 in the morning Angelo is waiting for from the Colombian airport of Cali, the first flight to Haiti I go to conduct participatory theater workshops with NGO Haitian staff the theme of the shows that we will bring to six communities affected by a hurricane is the Safe reconstruction of their homes The passion for participatory theater dates back to the times when the 42 -year -old Viveav In Turin here Angelo learned to conduct workshops and shows using above all the set of techniques called Oppressed Theater and settled by the Brazilian director Augusto Boal I conducted workshops in Italy and in various African and Latin American countries in Colombia I don't have a single employer job For various NGOs and universities and from January 2018, the start of teaching at the University of Cali as the theater and community professor as well as teaching my role will be to accompany the theater students during their internships in schools of difficult neighborhoods psychiatric hospitals prisons And rural communities the push to leave Senegal and his previous life came from the theater and from one of his first masters Hector Aristizabal Colombiano who had to leave the country in the nineties following threats of death of the paramilitary happened at the end 2016 when Colombia signed peace agreements with one of the groups The biggest armed in the country I called Hector and I asked him do you think that we can do something to accompany reconciliation in your country using the theater he replied to me yes I made the decision to follow this passion of mine and I started angel's dream In fact, it is to develop specific theatrical techniques to accompany former fighters and communities affected by conflicts in a reconciliation process I would like to experiment with this method in Colombia and then apply it with the necessary adaptations in Syria with the Rohingya refugees of Burma in Congo I would like to found a school of Theater for reconciliation where people from all over the world can learn theatrical techniques to be applied in the post -conflict contexts that they will then be able to bring to their countries adapting them to their cultures I have not given up on anything when I decided to change work while telling it speaks with voracity and not focuses on what he left but On how much he would like to build so much that the transition from being an employee of the great NGO to freelance of theater does not believe he had any impact on his daily life I did not give up anything when I decided to change work tells Angelo by listing how much superfluous he has always chosen to Eliminate from the car to pre -packaged foods passing through the decision not to change clothes and electronic objects all this has allowed me to save and acquire a less consumer lifestyle a choice that has certainly helped him in the adaptation that always serves in an overseas transfer The possibility of living abroad is very useful and contributes to creating a more open culture even in our country for those who like me often and keeps solid ties with Italy I think that living abroad is a big contribution to the social development of Italy the problem does not it is to get out of Italy therefore but create the Conditions because those who have been abroad and want to return to find opportunities to do so by bringing their experience in his waiting hours to Calm airport to ask himself if he has ever turned back after leaving what he is often seen in Italy as the So much sorting of the fixed seat, it is important to take your passions seriously and be concrete in planning the steps that lead us to do what we really want sometimes it is necessary to prepare perhaps for years then when a door opens you have to leave without regrets
He left the house one morning with a dozen friends who accompanied him to the airport I remember that one of them according to them on the other part of the road screamed to my mother NSE worried signo that in a month in Rista had left to learn English and it Spanish no one expected that Francesco Cipolla would be away from Rome almost ten years earlier in the United Kingdom to perfect the language then in Holland and Spain as a gypsy waiter and for three years in London where he started as a warehouse worker of a well -known women's clothing brand Now the 29 -year -old deals with the entire process of distribution and production of accessories for the European and Asian market I have never had a good relationship with the study and the initial project was to leave to learn the languages ??in fact Francesco in Rome had a job and yes He already paid for a rent for only 18 years the choice to pack his suitcases was not connected to a working necessity but to the desire D The widening his horizons to smell his life slamming us against biting it simply I was hungry for something that was not food and in addition to filling his lifestyle cravings in these ten years Francesco has also managed to go from the warehouse to the place in business between pleasure trips and of work between Europe and China nobody understands anything more the most frequent question that they ask me when they call me is what part of the world you are now socializing in London it is very difficult you can chat with half a neighborhood when you go out but the day after you will hardly feel you feel Enriched and yet living in London it is not always easy here the word busy busy busy occupied ed is a mental state it is not easy to make friends in the English capital socializing in London it is very difficult you can chat with half a neighborhood when you go out but the day after you will hardly feel enriched And to get out of this suffering, the 29 -year -old Roman has done nothing more if Don't dive completely in the work I worked day and night and if possible the weekends so I was too tired to think and in the meantime your family starts to miss you and at the same time the first satisfactions begin to go abroad because it is an experience That makes you grow and what it forms but it takes head and luck otherwise it is a moment to get lost in the vortices of depression or too much fun and here is the phrase that his friend had told his mother almost ten years ago before accompanying him to the airport Most of the people as that friend of mine said after a month returns with the difference that he has a couple of thousand euros less and who manages to stay what the freedom to have chosen his life is gains to be free is the most beautiful feeling the Italians go abroad not to leave their country to sink but in a spirit of survival however while his carr Ira is growing in the United Kingdom Francesco does not exclude to return to Italy one day because it is my land and I am very attached to us not to say jealous, he lacks the quality of life understood as food and climate and yet those who have moved abroad cannot choose to return to a house where there are high chances of being unemployed or ending up making the fish stink always from the head is the problem in fact according to the 29 year old, the so -called brains are on the run from Italy because the government has made sure to Making them flee the politics by sinking the Italians with ridiculous taxes and contracts the Italians abroad not to let their country sink but in a spirit of survival also after you get used to certain mechanisms of foreign countries it is difficult to accept the return to the stone age Yet if the mind sets for a few moments while the Roman manager speaks he realizes that the one -way flight for r the Colosseum would take it all right if he let himself be moved only from his heart Rome for me is all family influence and Romanity and when in the south west Londonse the melancholy becomes unsustainable of the verses in Romanesco I remember when I was a little boy who always sang me mine be Berletto you said you are a stick of the old age of me give me na carammella or n chocolate nun je to my daughter the reading interrupts the gaze goes to the title of the poetry for my granny because even if it has been ten years that Rome is far the feelings continue to go out in Romano
Sometimes to understand things you have to distance himself when I started I had a negative idea of ??Italy but after six years abroad I realized that we have a potential that no other country has to tell himself from Edinburgh is Samanta Mariani born 36 years ago in Aquino in Province of Frosinone a degree in medical biotechnology at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia and a doctorate at San Raffaele in Milan at that point I wanted to go abroad so I chose Philadelphia to make the post doc focusing my investigations on leukemia I tell That would have been my only experience outside instead in Italy I no longer returned to the end of the scholarship, however, it decided to return to Europe were three beautiful years but soon I realized that in the United States the social system is not much strong and often you feel abandoned to yourself underlines Edinburgh has been the chosen destination the university is between The best of Europe and here I also managed to change my research explains Samanta has passed from the study of the disease to that of stem cells almost all patients with leukemias at some point are forced to resort to marrow transplantation with All the problems that entails from the possibility of rejecting the lack of donors my goal is to start from the patient's healthy cells and then replacing them in this way the operation would no longer be necessary to live abroad has allowed her to expand her horizons in Italy The academic environment is more restricted less international here instead I continually compare myself with cultures other than mine and this is of great help even in the laboratory because it allows me to analyze different variables also its approach to life has radically changed for me they are shortening the distances I have no problems if I have to take two planes in the tour d The few hours only to participate in a conference underlines but in these years of distance from Casa Samanta has understood above all the importance of networking when I still lived in Philadelphia I met Chiara Bertolaso ??specializing in pediatrics with whom we developed the idea of ??brain storm a Network that today involves some of the most important associations of Italian researchers, theirs is a group work that is placed as a dialogue platform and which aims to collaborate to carry out increasingly important research projects a full and satisfactory life His but sometimes the thought flies to Italy from a social and human point of view I would really like to return even if I realize that to date there are not the possibilities from us the researcher is not considered a worker and has not enough guarantees to build A solid future that is motherhood or regulated holidays here have no probl Emi to grant you the mortgage even if you have a three -year contract adds perfectly they know that the academic world works like this thus making Italy risks losing the way many excellence in these six years I have known many Italians and I have realized that ours level of preparation is very high but unfortunately our country still does too little to encourage researchers to stay
 I miss Italy and the beach of Riccione where I grew up and the people with whom you can safely do conversation without having ever seen them before but the Italy that I miss no longer Alberto Giannetto was born in Padua but Riccione is the place where he grew up and He has learned to love Italy in the last eighteen years, the 46 -year -old astronomer has monitored the changes in his city as he observes it in the short stays in which he returned to Italy since 1999 in fact Alberto moved to the United Kingdom in a country near Oxford perhaps staying Immersed in a reality it is less noticeable how this is changing for Alberto instead is very clear how in recent years his Romagna has tinged with gray and it is not only the landscape that has changed every time I come back and I feel things that leave me stunned it is On television that on the street and in Romagna or have built a new shopping center or have fallen dozens of maritime pines on the streets where they play I want as a child to build a new coastal transport system so much that year after year the memory of Italy is increasingly distant from the real country when I return to Romagna or have built a new shopping center or have fallen dozens of maritime pines emigrated in times that still They did not completely glimpse the working crisis of the following decade after a degree in astronomy at the University of Bologna and having worked for some company between Bologna and Rimini was more curiosity to make him leave on the threshold of the thirty years wondered how long he would take time To find accommodation and a job while going up on the plane directed to Stansted Airport, the answer would have arrived shortly three weeks a software house in brightening south of Oxford here is the place where he would spend the 12 years the interview was massacring And I had to show them what I knew and also what I didn't know then after a passage Ggio in a big American multinational for which he was dealing with IT security now Alberto returned to work for the same company with which he had started in 1999 I no longer looked back two weeks to have a refund fees simple rules and made to be respected And a bank account without taxes of course obviously the United Kingdom is not the paradise just think of the show that presents itself in English supermarkets in the fruit and vegetable department a desolant show that will remain well imprinted in the mind of any emigrant beyond the sleeve or how much the Privatization of public transport has detonated prices in exchange for services sometimes abominable because they are expensive and crowded and yet perhaps it is not price to live in a country where it is heard that the institutions are really at the service of the citizen here it is normal to contact their representative in Parliament for example and nine times out of ten you like you Ponde on headed paper of the House of Commons The filter of neutral information as it appears to Alberto's eyes that of the British National Service La BBC is another emigrated privilege because giving Italians who go abroad to responsibility for the conditions in which the country because eighteen years abroad are not few and they can lead to changing themselves but even their vision of the world have certainly changed too I have seen in person how things could be made to work for the common citizen and each time the comparison with the Italy is a strident like the boy from Via Gluck who no longer finds his green but only houses and concrete so year after year the astronomer remains increasingly stunned by the cementing of the Romagna Riviera here in England have a concept that I really like that of Green Belt or areas outside the urban centers where it is not possible to build is for this reason I want that the beautiful English campaign is so uncontaminated the local administrations forbid the construction in these areas the story stops and a sigh comes mixed with frustration even the Riviera Romagnola would have needed a green Belt to protect the hinterland that seems to me during the course of the years has changed green to gray in a fairly indiscriminate way and while you observe your land worsening year after year a question is repeated as a mantra because giving Italians that go abroad to responsibility for the conditions in which the country is only He party understands what it means to suffer remotely for his land whether from the United Kingdom you look at the land of the sea sun pizza and mandolin whether from Italy you think of your land devastated by bombs and famines but this only an emigrant can know
 In Italy the conditions to be able to live autonomously at the age of 30 are few and geographically confined to the north Enrico Varrecchione he says with conscience because he is among those who after years of work abroad was able to try to return to live in Italy according to him Precisely because it comes from the north perhaps if I came from a village in the province of Crotone I would have done a little more effort not that the road is not uphill for the 30 -year -old who after four years spent outside the Belpaese since this summer has returned to live in Gavi Paesino of 5 thousand inhabitants between Liguria and Piedmont here we are perhaps a little isolated tells Enrico and yet in that village C it is a priceless component of his life his family live abroad ends up isolating you and sometimes it is good to ritualize in his origins to deal with Something more familiar because for the 30 -year -old Piedmontese to settle the Oltralpe can also be synonymous with solitude and depression is A story that do not tell many probably due to shame or fear of showing that they did not have it explains Enrico remembering the panic attacks of some time ago I talked to an Italian psychologist who deals with helping expats and confirmed me how this problem is Much more widespread than you think on the one hand there are no support structures in the reference countries also because perhaps it is important to deal with someone who speaks their mother tongue from the other in Italy there are few professionals willing to help online I spoke With an Italian psychologist who deals with Expat, he told me that the sense of solitude is more widespread than it is believed after a degree in journalism at the University of rebro in Sweden in the last four years Henry has lived in four different countries dealing with more things Italian school disappears in Ireland and UK IT in Hungary and football matches such as SC Out in Sweden, also working as a freelance journalist his story tells her to the plural because with him in Italy the tranquility has not given him only his family but also his companion former Hungarian banking who after 12 years of work in Budapest of the routine has I chose to follow him in Italy my partner has always appreciated our culture and our way of living and wanted to try to live in a difficult environment like our ego instead I would like to test myself after studying and working away from Italy because the project of Enrico has a name is called Willy Worka and it is an online community with over 5 800 followers on Facebook I would like to be able to help those who want to move abroad perhaps then to return and make their knowledge and resources available in addition to this project that is still in Enrico development phase from his village deals with translations and has returned to write for some local newspapers In the last four years I have managed to put something aside on which I could count in these first months but I still don't know how much I will remain in Italy because obviously you cannot live only air or dreams also his partner in fact struggles to find work despite The knowledge of German English and a little Russian is a problem that we have also encountered with other expats that live in Italy I am now trying to risk in Italy but if you cannot be able to be forced to leave again the anger rises at the end of the day because the Pair knows perfectly that abroad the working situation could be easier and yet they have chosen to stay if tomorrow I sent a curriculum to a call center in Budapest in a week I would have a job if I went to London and I started shooting the companies that interest me most Within a month I would be okay now I'm trying to risk in Italy but if I couldn't, I will be forced to leave vo think you will regret having returned home I hope no but it is not a circumstance to be excluded
 No, it is not true that if one wants to be a surgeon in Italy he must wait for 40 years to enter the operating room, Professor Marco Montorsi, president of the Italian Surgery Society, will respond to an article that appeared on IlFattoquotidiano it in which Matteo Frasson told His experience as a surgeon in Valencia in Spain certainly the block of the turn over throughout the country even in the hospital has led to an increase in the average age even in healthcare but the situation albeit slowly and often with a leopard spot is changing explains the doctors to mount themselves And the surgeons are on average younger than 10 years ago despite the blocking of hires and the loss from 2008 to 2015 of about 30 of the positions due to the absence of competitions to mount the University, it is slowly rejuvenating the average age of the associated professors has fallen from 52 to 50 years and the appointment age is today around 40 against a threshold C He first placed himself on the 50 55 explains we are faced with a return of brains for the sector rather than return I prefer to speak of the circulation of the brains since the world of work is so dynamic and global today that if a doctor or surgeon decides To try an experience abroad, it is absolutely natural that he does it and vice versa adds Montari and in this circulation there is also a return of Italian professionals with foreign countries and yet there are still many young Italian surgeons who encounter difficulties already at the beginning of his career the complaint of the Students has founded bases continuous every year against a number of medicine graduates that oscillates between 9 11 thousand scholarships for the specialization that cover no more than 60 C is therefore an evident imbalance the regions try to compensate for this deficiency of contracts with their own funds but evidently cannot fully satisfy the B Isogno on this front C is an open discussion with the MIUR the MEF that must allocate the resources and with the regions once they have become surgeons then many go abroad just like Matteo Frasson C it must be said that he was not forced to leave he has Won a Fellowship in Spain and therefore decided to have an overconfine experience had remained too he would probably have had a chance of work in Italy perhaps not with the times he desired certainly I don't want to deny that with the blocking of hires and the lack of bags of study many boys are forced to seek work also in other countries such as Spain and the United Kingdom in which there are certainly more places available but continuing to mount the prospect of a reopening of the hiring with an even generational change opens better possibilities also in our country more than of Diaspora Montarsi prefers to speak of circulation out of the exit of Italian brains that Rigu ARDA Also other countries such as the United Kingdom and France Return these are isolated cases, instead, comments Professor Pierluigi Marini President of Acoi Association of Italian Hospital Associations Association is not easy once you return to reconstruct a career in Italy I know the condition of young Italian surgeons well adds many are forced After the specialization to work in private facilities under 10 euros, the insurance must be added to this that costs between 4 and 5 thousand euros l year a problem that originates from that phenomenon that has now become unbearable and all Italian of the legal medical dispute that It makes a surgeon evaluate a professional hardly insured and who generates in young people a lot of concern so as to induce them not to choose marine surgery then returns to the problem of training the training courses in Italy are not adequate at the time our specializing are not satisfied with their iter fo they have difficulty entering the world of work and therefore they think abroad as an alternative valid to train and exercise their profession we hope that the new post -graduate reorganization law will be used correctly so as to relaunch our specialization schools and make them attractive I want to be clear to young people on this point if it continues so the Italy will risk remaining without surgeons and we will be forced to import them from foreign countries always admitted that someone decides to come Italian surgery concludes has always been reference in the world but to continue playing the role that The compete in Italy and abroad requires sustainability we need the institutions close to us
When ten years ago he landed for the first time at Luqa airport after four spent wandering among the counties of the United Kingdom it was a bit like setting foot the palms of the prickly pears in the walls of limestone stone houses and that almost subtropical climate So far from the grayness of Stevenage who often in spite of winter rains still gives you the magic of a Christmas in Bermuda and T Shirt returning even by dream Frankie replies donal then I think again maybe I go back to my parents I am the only child Frankie at the registry office is Francesco Nanni 35 years old one of the many Italians residing today on the island of Malta tourist destination among the most areas of the Mediterranean described by the detractors but also by many users as a sort of Panama in European sauce to attract the many migrants mainly from Italy Spain and England not it is more only the pastel blue sea here c is a decidedly facilitated tax system for an imp renator investing is much easier and then the bureaucracy in a few days open your company like the biblical expectations that we have in Italy certainly the Belpaese does not forget even after a dip in the waters of Silema Beach I'm fine with the sea here is a swimming pool but As soon as I can I come back my family miss my friends I piadina the cappelletti The folklore of a city like Rimini the memory of that dimension of the dream of which my illustrious fellow citizen Federico Fellini spoke well to those who ask him to return in short reply that his hymn remains Mameli's but to redo the suitcases is not yet now Malta has so much to offer him above all because this as he repeats often is not a passenger crisis, Italy must change the march otherwise it does not come out it almost seems that the Italians themselves have surrendered abandoned to their losers We struggle to get to the end of the month each in their own shell lacks participation social activism I would like Seeing people go down to the street to fight for their future you need a total rebirth in the meantime I am very well here the Italy must change otherwise it does not come out it almost seems that the Italians themselves have abandoned themselves to their losers Francesco the first flight had already taken it in the 2003 when only his diploma and a good mastery of English had decided to give up everything to move to Huddersfield an ancient medieval town in the heart of Great Britain halfway between Leeds and Manchester I wanted to make a life growing being independent Rimini and the His people began to go tightly taken on everything and I went today those who flee do it above all out of desperation in search of a job but mine were personal motivations so without too many pretensions I was satisfied with what was first was dishwasher and then waiter in 2007 But while I had just started the betting company as a telephone broker Sse for whom I worked proposed to me the transfer to Malta from there began my new life to Stranger is a friend you have t met year who in Italian plays pressed so a stranger is a friend who you have not yet met me teach me a client of the Restaurant where I worked tells and a phrase that I often repeat especially when in front of an increasingly globalized world I still clash with the stupid distrust of people here is a little prejudice towards Italians as with us with blacks and Muslims But I really believe in work integration, I deal with social game also in one of the local teams of flag football today Francesco after having closed with an not always transparent world like that of online gaming which still remains one of the new economic engines has decided to open his own VAT number for a year I have started a small business to make my experience on the territory available to new arrivals rio I do advice and I am a multiisector intermediary you have to open a company in Malta you have to buy a house you can ask me so I pay for living and I am happy by helping Italians sure if I returned I would try to work as a social media manager what I do today as mediator would not be possible there is a completely different comparison system from us what I do today as a mediator would not be possible there is a completely different comparison system the Italians who decide to move to the island every year are continuously increasing because Malta is A country in strong growth especially for some sectors with a very low unemployment rate far from the country of the toys that Francesco had known in 2007 in Malta there are many opportunities but today the cost of living has increased a lot of pasta, the bread rents above all e even the foreigners who come here to invest or However, finding a safe job but it is no longer as it once was not for everyone to the guys who ask him how it is to live in Malta he answers with a pinch of philosophy no city will never be like the one in which you were born to leave for anger e despair is human but do not think that outside the problems are different there are everywhere every world is a country you have to have so much spirit of adaptation and having the courage to get involved to achieve one's goals
They have between 18 and thirty years in their pocket a Working Holiday visa or the permission to remain in Australia at most twelve months a year in which lawyers and surgeons will wake up at the dawn to collect fruit in the fields while doctors and psychologists will find themselves serving Tables is the generation of the under 30s committed to moving to Australia those who do not have time to worry about those who continue to call them children because they are too busy making the jump in the void 15 thousand kilometers from home those I met here along the Australian roads They are the

2005 at 15 138 in 2014 2015 it is difficult to give the figures of how many Italians are looking for their way in Australia since arrivals from the Belpaese who in 2015 2016 were 100 565 do not distinguish between those who are on vacation or who are looking for To emigrate to these figures, it is good to remember that the permanent residence or the objective f Inale of those who try to emigrate and that is the passage preceding the Australian citizenship editor's note remains a mirage for the most part only 496 Italians had obtained it in 2005 2006 reaching 1 309 of 2014 2015 figures decreased but which remain minimal compared to the number of Italians who try to get it but who are these Italian Working Holiday often unemployed guys who have finished the university and cannot find work in their sector or find it precarious and underpaid or even because of the crisis have seen the revenues of their profession decrease When they did not lose it directly, the same also

there is no future and I was in a hurry to have one the process of recognizing Italian titles in Australia is long and expensive tortuous it is not easy to adapt to doing a different job from that for who has studied many years and yet the process of recognizing Italian titles in Australia is long and expensive tortuous and this is how Marco's path is also that of many of those Italians who have tried to find roots in Australia I was a waiter The dishwasher the seller brings the warehouse worker L employee and obviously I also worked on the farms by collecting mango and lime in northern

personal battle with the future can also happen to come across people who criticize the so -called brains on the run because according to them they let the poor Italy sink to make those who remain the reasons for those who leave a wrong to everyone does not take into account the often sad difficult stories of precariousness and zero future that are behind one person who emigrates does not take into account what the heart breaks embrace everyone at the airport and check in Without knowing when you see them, you do not take into account that you find ourselves suddenly foreigners to have to start again often on your own do not take into account that these people continue to follow the Italian events even from the other part of the world continue to feel Italian despite everything to say that maybe they could still do a lot in their country but it is the country itself that not to give them the opportunities to make them if this is to escape then the sense of any old or new emigration escapes us
 I am lucky because I do one of the most beautiful works in the world, unfortunately, however, I do it in a country that underestimates my profession Antonio Torella 33 years old from San Nicandro Garganico in the province of Foggia born in France but lived from an early age in the Apulian province is one of the 450 thousand nurses who form the backbone of the Italian Health System not only is the contract professor at the University of Bologna where he graduated and where since 2008 he has been working in the trauma center of the hospital a satisfactory path and yet Antonio after a few years in contact with the Italian system he feels that Something is wrong with the Italian collective imagination, the nurse is the one who assists the doctor beyond the various specializations that explains in the other countries, on the other hand, is the person who follows the therapy that leads the patient to get out of the hospital doors today after having done a Experience in the United Kingdom who changed his life he collected the witnesses Onianze of many colleagues around the world in a Overseas Nurses book travel through the nursing profession a way to encourage young nurses to travel and learn to learn by reflecting also on the gaps of the Italian system compared to our neighbors the author's rights of the book will then go At the Onlus Amici of Ampasilava who manages a Vozo hospital in Savadoaka in the South East of Madagascar, the best nursing system remains that of the Scandinavian countries the best nursing system remains that of the Scandinavian countries affirms both for the gratuity and for the quality level of the offer and for The salaries even if that of the language remains a rock in the United States, however, the anesthesiologist nurse is one of the most paid figures on a professional level but Spain is undoubtedly the country later as legislation on the subject points out here in fact the degree path provides for three years of theory and one of Spec ialization this avoids students confirms the nurse in Bologna, for example, I found myself several times to have to explain in the ward to those of the second year parts of theory that are made to the third in France, instead there is a system similar to the Italian one although the salary level It is about 500 euros more net more per month while Ireland according to the interviews carried out by the Apulian nurse is currently one of the best destinations for the category since the specializations are recognized as in the United Kingdom but a less in -depth knowledge of the language is required now in England C is a need for a C1 to access the profession and it is difficult even for the British Antonio has always been curious in 2013 he enrolled in an English language course in London with his intention to have an experience abroad and the following year is hired by Brighton and Sussex University Hospital as Nurse's scrub I have always wanted to do l er Asmus but having to maintain the scholarship I could not afford to lose exams reminds the time, the mobility consisted only in a few months for the specialization today knows perfectly the academic difficulties as a contract professor receives 600 euros gross l year and cannot even sign the exam To its students because formally the owner is an anesthesiologist in Italy out of 450 thousand nurses only 40 are associated professors and it is not a problem of funds but of mentality in Italy out of 450 thousand nurses only 40 are associated professors and it is not a problem of funds but of mentality and it is beyond the sleeve that opens my eyes before leaving I thought that in my hospital in Bologna it was all perfect I was wrong you can always improve and in the United Kingdom the specializations affect with ten years of experience I took 1800 pounds 2600 euros working 4 days a week 10 and a half a day I tell you could pay for both the mortgage In Italy that the rent in Brighton in Italy I perceive just over half but what strikes him most is the way to approach work give you access to the databases to the libraries organize exits between colleagues and constantly ask you feedback to make you feel involved in Last bell of alarm on the lack of nurses in the Belpaese was launched by the OECD all appeal would miss 60 thousand nurses while the unemployed are 15 thousand in England apply a goal of six patients for nurse comments here we even get to a sixty relationship to one also even the salaries range from 1500 pounds to almost 10 thousand and in the middle C it is a world of specializations from us if you have 25 years of seniority you can aspire to a maximum of 300 euros more per month underlines hospital companies should rethink the nursing assistance in Italy not He sucks everything and it is here that I chose to grow my son m A to the young people I say you travel because only in this way can you help improve this country
For the Minister of Economy Pier Carlo Padoan the budget of the trend of the labor market is characterized by lights and shadows because if it is true that unemployment has dropped but is still too high around 11 the number of graduates is growing but is still too low And above all for the minister who spoke to the inauguration of the academic year at the Sapienza of Rome, still too many young people leave our country for better opportunities to the foreign few words who, however, on the net unleash the controversy no longer know who to remove the pension writes Matteo while MC79 He underlines which competent party has ruled in recent years that of the escape of Italians abroad is a theme that has been raised many times in the political field Matteo Renzi, for example, had stamped it as mere rhetoric and the Minister of Labor Giuliano Poletti at the end of 2016 said It is not that there are 60 million pistols here I know people who are an date away and that it is good that it is where it went because surely this country will not suffer to no longer have them among the feet words that he had then rectified by saying he expressed himself badly but the exodus at foreign foreign continues to be a node also economic as well as social for Confindustria, for example, has an annual cost of 14 billion euros in the year and the escape in recent years continues to involve tens of thousands of graduate people graduated over 50 and also specialized figures who elsewhere find higher salaries or a better quality of life according to the Italian Reports in the 2017

 A degree in Communication Sciences and what you think of making us in his five -year university path and which ended with a 110 and praise Isotta Pieraccini felt repeated this refrain several times and yet she strong with a choice made with the heart and with Her head has never been influenced and the weather is giving her reason born in Vernio village in the province of Prato 28 years ago she studied between Bologna and Florence but immediately after the specialist bought a one -way air ticket even if I had done the Liceo linguistic I realized I did not know English enough so I decided to fill this gaps telling the suitcases and I started for London at that time had not yet had a precise plan the first goal to achieve was learning the language I worked as waitress 35 hours a week and the rest of the time I dedicated it to the study remember I attended courses with people from other laws laws O Hemingway I watched movies as for many compatriots for her also the English capital was a Washing Machine I met many people including three Spanish boys who soon became my friends explain in the summer of 2015 they invite her to spend a few days from them in Barcelona is It was a real love at first sight remembered two years since that day and I never gone the Catalan city it soon became its new home London had a little tired admits I was missing the climate and the atmosphere that you breathe In Latin countries London had a little tired of me I lacked the climate and the atmosphere that you breathe in the Latin countries in Barcelona, ??but you had to start over from the end I had never studied the Spanish in my life but in six months I managed to learn it remembers and in the meantime to keep myself I worked as a web writer freelancer for some sites once the obstacle is overcome begins to work As a waitress, a friend of mine had just opened a restaurant and I decided to help him in the delicate phase of the start of the activity he explains but the communication dot was always there I deeply loved the studies I did and I have always put commitment and passion for this for this At a certain point I realized that the time had come to get involved and build my way last summer starts looking around and sending curriculum and soon a good news comes a place as a marketing and communication assistant for a Catalan company that operates Internationally it has been here for a few months and I could not be happier by part time, the use then turned into a full time work eight hours a day but with flexible times and I am lucky enough to be surrounded by an excellent group of colleagues underlines and finally can put into practice how much the reputation around my degree is not studied is not of the The best admits but the truth is that people and our political class do not know the communication sector at all and do not realize that it is the basis of the success of any company or movement to date is no doubt about her future in Barcelona I am happy I found everything I was looking for while the situation in Italy always seems to me too nebula now concludes as now to return I don't think about it
 My first and only house will always remain Italy, Sara Pagliarani tells with a Koala in her arms wanted to enter the circle of Italian veterinarians who deal with wildlife but to do it in Italy it is like winning the lot often must participate in public calls and the History is always the same in Italy often and willingly when the calls come out you already know who the available places will be assigned only the name is missing in the clear but it is as if there was already nothing to be worth the high training course in wildlife e public health at the University of Milan or the degree in Veterinary Medicine at the University of Bologna I graduated full of dreams and desire to do but I saw myself barred many roads and close many doors in the face so much that the dream of being veterinary In Italy it was dissolved at the exact moment in which I realized that my love for animals was not enough to make me go to work you are days a week for 500 euros per month the dream of working in Italy was broken in front of the idea of ??working six days a week for 500 euros per month after the university in fact for the 28 -year -old from Cesena the choice that had been proposed was among a Doctorate without a scholarship as can be accepted after five years of university away from home with the money of mom and dad and an underpaid work closed inside four walls the recent graduate veterinarians are often exploited for 12 hours a day for free with the excuse of the first you need Learn as if it were our fault the fact that the Italian University does not provide sufficient practical training and that we leave the university without knowing even keeping a syringe the perspective after passing the obstacle course of the first years of work is to be paid as freelancers with literally ridiculous figures around her very colleagues were starting to move to the United Kingdom or com Unque in countries where they felt recognized not only from an economic point of view so after training internships in Italy Rome Trento and in the United States thanks to a scholarship of the University of Bologna, the process for application in Australia began almost by chance I would not have Never thought I can be selected and above all that I can receive a scholarship from the Australian government I feel lucky to have had the opportunity to be able to do what makes me happy in a paradisiacal place like Australia today Sara is at the first of the four years of the His doctoral to the University of Queensland in Brisbane in practice deals with an infectious illness of the Koala La Chlamydiosis realizing the unfinished dream of being able to work on the autochthonous wildlife I admire the courage and resourcefulness of those who are doing it in Italy by going against the system I tried but I couldn't fight it I will definitely try again at if not at the moment the 28 -year -old from Romagna has in front of him the beginning of an all -foreign academic career we young people who go out of the Italian universities we are demotivated we are told that if we really wanted we could find work that we are Choosy instead I believe that to be satisfied both as Cut the wings of birds prevent young minds from expressing themselves and trying to make this world a better house for all of us young people is said that we are choosy and instead I think to settle for both how to cut the wings of birds certainly go to the other side of the world has a price breaks every rhythm and certainty you no longer know who to ask for help in moments of need or which friend to call when you feel a little down and you would only need an ice cream and yet this is the price to pay to get away from a world of I work where you don't feel respected nobody especially at the beginning wants to be paid as much but only be recognized as professional and incited to do better while working in a stimulating and satisfying environment not in the climate of Italian terror where you are afraid of losing your job if you ask a free day on New Year or if you communicate to the employer you intend to have a child and that's how Italy becomes an Eldorado to be achieved only when you now have gray hair I could not think of passing my old age anywhere other if not surrounded by my hills by the flavors of Romagna and by the people I love but I don't know when and if and if it will happen
There is a complex that grips the young people of Southern Italy who comes from the south believes less in his dreams Fabrizio Creazzo are 25 years old and was born and raised in Messina this complex intimidates and demotive the young people of the South convinced that many opportunities are far away for them or Unattainable in his stories Fabrizio paints a southern Italy in which a Sicilian would never think of aspireing to the best European universities and out of habit would be satisfied with what the reality offers him where he was born by thinking about my past who would have ever imagined that a common boyfriend of Messina he would have managed to study in the fourth European University and win a financing of hundreds of thousands of euros simply by sending his curriculum and instead despite the 25 -year -old in Sicily he has breathed a demotivating atmosphere made up of under -tenmission clientelism and sympathies for years it was enough for him to throw the gaze beyond the Alps to see the S Uo doctoral project in physical chemistry accepted at the University Paris Saclay and Ecole Polytechnique I come from the South but despite this with fatigue and sacrifices I was able to make my master's thesis in physics with the highest votes at the University of Sorbonne and obtain a complete financing from A laboratory of excellence to create my PHD always in France but not only in these few years of Parisian life Fabrizio was able to publish three scientific articles know the world experts of his work area and become a member of the editorial committee of a scientific journal a Only 25 years and I started from Messina all this in Italy would have been unthinkable in Italy in Italy it would have been unthinkable but what the pieces that brought it to Paris after an Erasmus to conclude his master's thesis at the Sorbonne First University were in practice French and fourth in the European ranking a degree in physics all univ Ethity of Messina and a 110 and praise in your pocket in 2015, the Sicilian began his career by working for three months as a physics professor in a private high school Messina but I was not economically sufficient I worked for a few euros now and while during the day he prepared the lessons In the classroom in the evening he sent curriculums practically all over the world in search of a place as a researcher, the emails were directed to Europe United States even the Arab Emirates the Italian academic world as often happens is not even taken into consideration very often in Italy, PhD is seen Like the last wheel of the chariot and its figure is not respected in multiple doctoral students do more hours of work than they then see their work torn and published with the name of the professor here I did not want to live according to these rules was France there First to accept his project and so once the Fabrizio loan started at a time of Paris to start his research with the goal of studying chemical reactions to produce hydrogen respecting the environment a doctorate in search of the ecological fuel of the future my PHD is completely financed by a private body that deals with national and international scientific cooperations in France In fact there is a great synergy between private entities and universities and Fabrizio has managed to find this funding thanks to the help of his French supervisor and his future university I believe that in Italy to access a doctorate there are no forms of private financing but only a ban At national competition and we know how these competitions work where very often meritocracy is not the parameter of choice I even before the end of my doctorate know how and where to continue my career advancement fears that he is rhetorical Fabrizio when he cannot avoid tell how in France unlike in Italy yes in He really dresses on young people considering them a resource even if they are foreigners as in his case we young people here we do not need to wait for the end of university studies to be introduced into the world of work and have an employment that allows us to live in dignity because what he has found Oltralpe The Sicilian physicist was a solid perspective for the future, the students here already know that during or at the end of the university studies they will start working even before the end of my doctorate I will know how and where to continue my career advancement is very difficult That someone closes the door to a boy in the face, especially if you have a surplus formed not in the public and private sector, permanent contracts and for Fabrizio's experience they are not at all a utopia as in Italy in France if you don't work is because you don't want work and not because of the deficit of employment a ride from Messina to Paris who also wanted to say to be able to remove some economic satisfaction since Fabrizio takes a salary that is about twice that an Italian PhD and three times I perceived in Messina as a professor of physics by remembering the Sicilian university years underlines how in the South there is no Interaction between school and work accordingly many children do not have the opportunity to meet social and cultural realities other than the precarious and unsatisfactory one that is offered in Italy and yet it would be enough to take a little courage to get out of their comforts and schemes believe in their dreams regardless of where It was born
 In Italy at 50 you are already considered old and when you are old in Italy you are useless this is why Claudio Farinelli moved to central America I am sorry but despite being 71 years old I don't feel at all old he had never lived abroad but On the 64 -year -old threshold and a few months at the pension Claudio and his wife decided to say goodbye to Turin to replace her with the candid landscapes of the Costa Rica would be my life if I had not moved here I don't even want to think about what what It was my daily life in Italy I am alive here but as happens to a pensioner who has always lived in Italy to find himself to spend the last part of his life beyond the Galeotto ocean was internet when by pure chance Claudio and Colei who would become His wife were browsing which countries were in the world with the highest quality of life the name of Costa Rica sprouted and despite not knowing anyone In that country a flicker of curiosity led the couple to book the holidays here in 2005 the script repeats itself from 2006 to 2009 when every year for a month Costa Rica becomes the destination of Claudio's holidays and his partner gradually We fell in love with the cordial Amabile people available and so it was that while the years passed and the pension approached in 2010 the last holiday turned into a definitive transfer to Liberia in the North West of the country gradually we fell in love with loved ones Cordial available we have invested all our savings in the purchase of two houses tells the 71 -year -old born in the Emilian municipality of Comacchio but lived for most of his life in Turin the one in which we live and a second rented house that provides us with half of the income necessary to live Decently, yet by moving to Central America Claudio and his wife have not chosen to live on income thanks to their Or savings I can't be with my hands in his hands in short, I don't want to be a pensioner in fact after a life spent first as a restaurateur and then at the head of a sales agency once he moved to Liberia the 71 -year -old opened a real estate agency to help Europeans and the American To make the same choice or to buy building land and houses in Costa Rica also the agency helps the novels Costarican to open current accounts and to obtain residence I do not feel over 70 and in fact I stopped smoking a lot and I regularly make fishing in apnea Claudio tells with sunglasses and Bandana around white hair the latest project of the pensioner is to transform together with financial friends an area of ??1 300 hectares into an eco -compatible village in green building with animal farms and dairy school for the production of very cheeses in the country, a project that would marry with the energy policy of the Costa Rica first state in the world capable of producing almost 100 of his energy from renewable sources the places where he was born but in Italy Claudio would be only an old pensioner in Italy you are useless at 50 years old nobody considers your experience indeed the experience It has a cost better to take young people to exploit fortunately I have always worked on their own but several of my friends have had difficulty returning to the world of work after a certain age here preferential files in offices and banks and discounts of 5 in the pharmacy supermarkets and shops for whom He is 65 years old and yet it is not only an economic question that pushes him to remain in the small state of the American center is also the philosophy that according to Claudio leads the Costarican to really respect those who have a few years in several preferential rows in offices and banks and discounts of 5 in Pharmacy supermarkets and shops for those who are 65 years old this regardless of that you have citizenship or foreign if You are elderly merit, however, I respect the only reason that has remained to the couple to return once l year to Italy is to keep relationships with friends and relatives alive for the rest I would never go back to live at my age I would consider it suicide
 After so many years of work in Italy we thought that we deserved a gift so we moved to Tunisia Manuela Bruzzo 63 years originally from Vicenza arrived in Hammamet together with her partner here since May 2016 enjoying the pension in a villa on the sea and a Now and a half of flight from home to Italy Manuela was dealing with exports within a company of international shipments with relationships also in Tunisia his partner Jos of Dominican origin has instead decided to leave the job to move to the Tunisian Gulf just landed in Hammamet Thanks to the assistance of specialized agencies, the couple was able to visit the houses and apartments of the city the most tourist of the North African town here is everything from small studios to sumptuous villas tells Manuela the choice fell on an independent villa a few steps from the sea with Four bedrooms two bathrooms two kitchen and storage room surrounded by a garden Ino of over 700 square meters with palm olive trees and a small swimming pool The monthly cost for the rent is 490 euros for the two of us could be enough even much less but we were unable to give up the garden Remember Manuela after a life of sacrifices we wanted the place Just for us and then it is not as far away as the cost of living is very low the 60 less on average compared to Italy and here you can even find the raw of Parma smiles the life of a couple without missing anything does not go beyond the 500 euros per month Tasses Manuela submitted a question to the institution by moving the residence from Italy to Tunisia certainly the bureaucracy at least in the initial phase was very articulated but also in this case thanks to the help of agencies in the area, everything has been settled no longer towards Taxes in Italy explains the retired Vicenza here in a year I pay how much I would pay in one month at home the days flow serene without stress Rule number one a wake up I get up calmly when I want to take my coffee in the garden and I make a few jobs in the house then you go to the beach with friends the sea is enchanting after the afternoon nap Manuela cares a little the garden bathing in the pool And then it comes out to shop eating an ice cream or making an aperitif and the next day you start again a day I will return home definitively but until they are healthy and the desire for the sea does not decrease here there are many Italians who arrived here to enjoy the pension but Italy is missing no after a life of sacrifices we wanted the right place for us and then it is not as far as it seems beyond the economic advantages for Manuela and partner Hammamet represents a happy island also for personal health the climate is also tempered D Winter the sun is all year old and they enjoy warm days even when maybe in Italy you are underzer in winter we go to the beach to do Long walks and when we have lunch in the garden the temperature exceeds 25 degrees continues every three months the couple returns to Vicenza to see friends and relatives my relationship with Italy still remains alive, I am and I remain Italian all my life is keen to say manuela One day I will return home definitively but until they are healthy and the desire for the sea does not decrease here to move to Hammamet requires only a little spirit of adaptation beyond the bureaucratic part there were no big difficulties in the early days we have committed ourselves To understand where to buy things here is a Carrefour chain and a thousand shops where you go to browse to pass the time fruit and vegetables are fresh every day to not talk about fish here you have to be patient, punctuality is not the best virtue of the Tunisini do everything with extreme calm defects when you call the plumber the antennist or a worker you have to arm yourself with patience the Punctuality is not the best virtue of the Tunisians do everything with extreme calm tells the secret so it is to be flexible to know how to adapt to bring to bring patience and experience as soon as possible then the whole family reaches Manuela and Jos brothers wives and grandchildren also my mom 86 years old arrives here by traveling from Only without problems adds beyond prejudices, Tunisia for Manuela is a safe country here people are very well arranged especially towards us Italians everyone smiles and greet us on the street as if they had always known me I feel much safer here that that In Europe there are neither hate nor fear
When Matteo Frasson arrived for the first time in Valencia with his wife two days had passed since his specialist degree in surgery came from the cold and gray Milanese climate tells the following weekend we were lying on the beach with 20 degrees and we said from here We no longer move it was November 13, 2009 I have a bad memory but I remember that date as the beginning of a new life for eight years Matteo has been working as a surgeon surgery and digestive service to the university of Valencia in 2016 He was awarded with the best publication in Spain in the surgical field and has just been appointed Profesor Aosociado to Universidad de Valencia here you have the opportunity to grow explains originally from Gallarate Matteo 38 years of age has arrived in Milan at the San Raffaele University for the course in Medicine for One year in 2006 he had a study and research experience in the United States P or in 2009 the one -year fellowship in Spain the selection was open to all young European surgeons and was based on CV interview and publications tells Matteo in Spain and his wife arrived with the goal of staying a year until the conclusion of the Fellowship Over time, things have changed we understood that here there is air space possibility of making a career we understand that here there is air space possibility to make a career in valencia everything is close enough the hospital is ten minutes from home and Matteo manages to carry on the His projects turn in the clinic from 8 to 15 lunch with the family and afternoon to spend together with the children we walk at the park under the house I put them on the bed here I have the opportunity to grow my children adds in the evening then I work on the PC on Paper and Publications Possions The cost of living here is also lower than cities like Madrid and Barcelona when we arrived in 2009 we were in Full of the crisis the prices of the rents were low as well as that of food and substantially remained unchanged in 2016 Matteo received the prize for best publication in Spain for research on the risk factors of anastomotic dehissence after intestinal resection for cancer colon It is one of the most frequent in western countries explains the Italian surgeon when we operate we remove a piece of colon and we have to go back to combine it if it does not correspond to correctly we are faced with an important complication that can lead to the patient's death in the 15th of the cases together with his group Matteo has analyzed a sample of 3 thousand patients in 50 different Spanish centers, the article was published on Annals of Surgery The most important surgical magazine in the world here in Spain C is an incredible Italian surgeon of Italian surgeons but of Spanish surgeons in Italy zero the main difference compared to Italy is that here there is room to grow to be independent in Italy without generalizing if one wants to be a surgeon must wait for 40 years to enter the operating room explains Matteo this thing you turn them abroad in France England and Spain this does not It exists when he arrived in Valencia at 31 years old Matteo entered the operating room immediately they did everything to teach me remember it was created thus a real diaspora of Italian surgeons here in Spain c is an incredible Italian surgeon adds For example, there are groups operating in Vigo in Madrid but also in Menorca and Alicante they are all young people who have the opportunity to learn their patients here if I had stayed in Italy at now I would still be waiting for my turn are all young people who here They have the possibility of learning to have its patients Italy for the moment remains far away I am building my career and my job here I know that in my country it would not be possible to do the same thing adds from us there is the primary who tends to operate everyone this morning I entered the operating room and together with my team I assisted mine Three patients as often happens is also a matter of mentality my boss has decided to rely on the guidance of a group of 25 researchers all older than me explains Matteo so the work published was born and then awarded the difference at national level is that of Spanish surgeons in Italy there is not even one and that of Italian surgeons in Spain there is a caterva concludes Matteo to return I don't think smiles but that does not know my mom know

When he was admitted to training in the company Nicola was the only foreigner present today after 6 years spent in Shanghai in China Nicola Fanni 29 years from Sardinia is manager of a large Chinese multinational telecommunications lives and works in the headquarters of Shenzhen and deals with ICT marketing and business technology in China Nicola was the first time in 2011 to study economics at the Fudan University State University of Shanghai during the specialist adding I received a scholarship from the Chinese government at the end of 2016 arrives the call from the company was Looking for a professional figure who did not deal only with international marketing but who spoke fluently English Chinese and also other languages ??recalls Nicola who speaks Chinese Japanese Spanish and French has exceeded the first telephone interview and all the other 5 subsequent steps and today deals with the Marketing linked to solutions and servants I who help companies and cities to become smart and transform themselves into the digital era are happy to work and we do not feel the frustration or stress that can be felt in other Japanese or Italian Chinese companies in the headquarters of Shenzhen the work occupies most of the Day I get up at 7 to 8 am in the office and we have breakfast there are many colleagues from other nations for this alternary English and Chinese depending on the meeting for lunch C is the possibility of choosing between a wide range of Chinese Korean Thai restaurants at 18 Once finished the shift C is a corporate bus that takes you directly under the house, the company demands a lot but has built around us a sort of city where we have any type of comfort with swimming pools gyms and modern apartments we are happy to work e We do not feel the frustration or stress that can be felt in other Japanese or Italian Chinese companies continues in The more I feel member of the team and not a simple manager in this sense I feel I live my Chinese dream Nicola Ama L Italia and explains to bring Sardinia to the heart sorry, however, he adds to see our potential not to be exploited to the best for the young man the explanation is rather simple Italy and China are two very different countries China is a land of great contradictions of great opportunities a land where optimism follows a difficult and complex dark historical period that has laid the foundations and dreams of the Chinese people who now S commits to realizing with all his strength and I feel like being part of it continuous but perhaps the biggest difference compared to Italy is the dynamism that is perceived even just walking in the streets of Shanghai or Hong Kong I refer to the concrete speed with which Business evolves digital transformation improves daily life or even the speed with which cities change or their urban structure with majestic skyscrapers to be part of this evolution positively influences everyday life because the possibilities become infinite and with commitment you can change your future and build a career this does not happen in Italy that comes from a historical phase However, it adds Nicola I look at the future with optimism and I think there will be improvements here the salaries increase significantly in a short time the differences also concern the rules that are the basis of the world of work in China, for example, the internships are always paid and the possibility of Becoming full time employee of the company is very high adds the Sardinian manager, although initially the pay is low, there are many career advancement opportunities and the wages increase significantly in a short time I have experienced studied worked with and between the Chinese for six years and not c It was a day when they were not a resource for me A surprise return to Nicola hopes for yes but only for working conditions at the height of what he currently receives and maybe I will manage to connect Italy and China by building a symbolic bridge between East and West l Italy with all its strengths and weaknesses occupies a beautiful slice I still remember the day of the degree for the specialist concludes Nicola decided to bring with me the flag of Sardinia of the four dying that symbol had always accompanied me and I wanted that among many Chinese colleagues there was also my land distant 10 thousand kilometers but proud of myself
 I love Switzerland, I consider it my second home, the future is here Mariangela Mortato 34 year old from Bologna for two years has lived in Basel after a three -year degree a specialist a phD in nanotechnology at the CNR and a postdoc in Nimega in Holland and then in Freiburg in Switzerland He decided to stop and have an experience outside the academic world today in fact works as a development engineer at a company that produces Biochemicals from renewable biomass in Italy the job situation is complex and the concrete opportunities are few tells Mariangela graduated in engineering when It was 2005 in 2008 the specialist arrived with full marks and the following year he won a scholarship for a doctorate at the CNR of Lecce at the time my goal was to stay in Italy and acquire experience and skills in an innovative research scope Then remember, however, the call came from foreign foreignness, then Switzerland until q Uaando Mariangela decided to move to the world of industry about two years ago I moved to Basel where I work as a development engineer The academic career is extremely competitive but there is the satisfaction of making one's contribution to the progress of knowledge of humanity the differences between University and company are substantial in the academic field, for example, the selection for the assignment of the funds is very competitive and to be more successful it is necessary to publish so much by developing a network of contacts and collaborations looking for funds is the task of team leaders and professors The academic career is Extremely competitive but there is the satisfaction of making one's contribution to the progress of knowledge of humanity explains Mariangela in the industrial sector, on the other hand, research becomes above all development and aims to create new processes produced or technologies by improving the existing ones the costs here must Being limited or linked only to the prefixed purposes The results so rarely are published but you have the satisfaction of seeing the realization of your ideas in the real world and of improving the life of the other Basels is a modern lively city I have the opportunity to be in a Sector that represents the future of the chemical industry and to make use and develop the skills and knowledge acquired during my studies adds the Bolognese engineer the work even if complex is compelling and stimulating I am part of a team of colleagues of different nationalities and this It gives me the opportunity to compare myself with different cultures and different professional approaches and to grasp the best aspects from each with its 170 thousand Inhabitants Basel more is a nerve center for chemistry, pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies in Italy rarely confront each other in multicultural environments And this represents an impoverishment for the CR Professional excitement and the differences compared to Italy in our country it is not easy to emerge for small and medium -sized enterprises that work in innovative sectors and do research and development for economic and bureaucratic issues therefore there is little work and if there is often it is not adequately paid Mariangela replies even more difficult is to attract talents from abroad with competitive opportunities with other countries rarely compare in multicultural environments and this represents an impoverishment for professional growth The Italian university preparation is excellent the problem according to Mariangela is that companies are looking for figures highly qualified and often do not have time or resources to devote to training without forgetting the orientation to work today the situation is complex, the boys who come out of the superiors cannot choose their university path only on their interests but also on the concrete opportunities that the Mon Do Del Lavoro offers advice to young people to question themselves but also learn the languages ??as soon as possible and achieve the objectives set in the shortest possible time because the degree is a starting point not of arrival even if Mariangela is very close to her country of non -origin It would ever return without adequate work and professional conditions in Switzerland I feel very well and I feel it every day more and more like my second homeland but now after Italy Holland and Switzerland tries to sum up Italy is my origin my DNA L Holland my past Switzerland my present and maybe the future yes sometimes I miss the kitchen kitchen concludes but I console myself with cheese and chocolate
